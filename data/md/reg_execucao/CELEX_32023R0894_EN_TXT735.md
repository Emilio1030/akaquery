C0261  Guaranteed rate – Yearly 
interest rate guarantee for the 
reporting year  Guaranteed yearly interest rate to the policyholder of the contract for the 
reporting year expressed as a percentage. 
Where no guaranteed interest rate is implicitly or explicitly provided in the 
contract, the cell should be left blank, where a guaranteed interest rate is implicitly 
or explicitly provided, this should be reported accordingly (e.g. ‘0 %’). 
Applicable where an average guaranteed interest rate is explicitly provided in the 
contract or where an alternative financial guarantee is implicitly provided, e.g. in 
form of a guaranteed sum assured, a guaranteed return of premiums. 
Where no yearly interest rate guarantee is prescribed explicitly in the contract, the 
implied (yearly) guaranteed rate for the reporting year should be reported. 
Not applicable for annuities stemming from non-life contracts.

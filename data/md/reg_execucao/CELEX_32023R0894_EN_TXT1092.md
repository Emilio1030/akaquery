C0080  Contractual Trigger Event  Description of the specific trigger that would oblige the SPV to make payment to 
the ceding (re)insurance undertaking. This information should be complementary 
to the information on ‘Type of Trigger(s) in the SPV’ and should be descriptive 
enough to allow supervisors to identify the concrete trigger, e.g. specific 
weather/storm indices for cat risks or general mortality tables for longevity risks.  
C0090  Same trigger as in underlying 
cedant’s portfolio  Identify if the trigger defined in the underlying (re)insurance policy with the pay– 
out trigger defined in the treaty is the same as the one defined in the SPV. The 
following closed list shall be used: 
1 – Same trigger 
2 – Different trigger  
C0100  Basis risk arising from risk– 
transfer structure  Identify the causes of basis risk (i.e. that the exposure covered by the risk–miti ­
gation technique does not correspond to the risk exposure of the insurance or 
reinsurance undertaking). The following closed list shall be used: 
1 – No basis risk 
2 – Insufficient subordination for note holders, 
3 – Investors’ additional recourse against cedant, 
4 – Additional risks were securitised subsequent to authorisation, 
5 – Cedants hold exposure to notes issued, 
9 – Other  
C0110  Basis risk arising from 
contractual terms  Identify the basis risk arising from contractual terms. 
1 – No basis risk 
2 – Substantial part of risks insured not transferred 
3 – Insufficient trigger to match risk exposure of cedant  
C0120  SPV assets ring–fenced to settle 
cedant–specific obligations  The amount of SPV assets ring–fenced for the reporting cedant, which are 
available to settle the contractual liabilities reinsured by the SPV for that 
specific cedant only (collateral assets specifically recognised on balance sheet of 
the SPV in relation to the obligation assumed).  
C0130  Other non cedant–specific SPV 
Assets for which recourse may 
exist  The amount of SPV assets (recognised on balance sheet of the SPV), not directly 
related to the reporting cedant but for which recourse exists. This would include 
any ‘free assets’ of the SPV, which may be available to settle the reporting cedant’s 
liabilities.EN  L 120/1092 Official Journal of the European Union 5.5.2023

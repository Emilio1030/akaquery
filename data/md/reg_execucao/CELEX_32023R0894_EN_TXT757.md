sions, Cash out–flows, future 
benefits and claims  The amount of split, for each line of business, as defined in Annex I to Delegated 
Regulation (EU) 2015/35, regarding direct business and accepted proportional 
reinsurance and Accepted non–proportional reinsurance, of cash flows for 
future benefits and claims used to determine the gross best estimate of 
premium provisions, i.e. the probability–weighted average of future cash out– 
flows, discounted to take into account the time value of money (expected 
present value of future cash–flows). In case of use of a stochastic methodology 
for the cash–flow projection, it is required to report the average scenario.

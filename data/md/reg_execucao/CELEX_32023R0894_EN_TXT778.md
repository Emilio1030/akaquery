The option chosen needs to be used consistently over the reporting periods, 
unless the distribution of claims changes significantly. 
For different reporting currencies National Supervisory Authorities need to define 
the equivalent options for the amounts to be used in the 20 brackets.

year N:N–14  The number of claims attributed to each of the accident/underwriting years N to 
N–14, whose accumulated claims incurred at the end of the reporting year falls 
within the start amount and end amount of the applicable bracket. The number of

year N:N–14  The accumulated and aggregated amount of claims incurred of all individual 
claims, attributed to each of the accident/underwriting years N to N–14, whose 
accumulated claims incurred at the end of the reporting year falls within the start 
amount and end amount of the applicable bracket. 
For smaller claims, estimations (e.g. default amount) are allowed as long as it is in 
line with the amounts considered in run–off triangles reported in Non–life 
Insurance Claims Information (template S.19.01). 
Accumulated claims incurred means the sum of gross claims paid and gross 
reported but not settled claims (RBNS) on a case-by-case basis for each and 
every single claim, open and closed, which belongs to a specific accident year/ 
underwriting year (AY/UWY).

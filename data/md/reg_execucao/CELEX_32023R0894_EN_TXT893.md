Liabilities (before the loss- 
absorbing capacity of technical 
provisions)– spread risk – 
securitisation positions – 
senior STS securitisation  This is the absolute value of the liabilities sensitive to the spread risk on senior 
STS securitisation positions, after the shock but before the application of the 
adjustment for the loss-absorbing capacity of technical provisions. 
This value shall only be reported where the split between R0461 to R0483 can be 
derived from the method used for the calculation. Where the split is not possible,

R0461/C0080  Absolute value after shock – 
Gross solvency capital 
requirement – spread risk – 
securitisation positions – 
senior STS securitisation  This is the gross capital charge for spread risk on senior STS securitisation 
positions, i.e. before the application of the adjustment for the loss-absorbing 
capacity of technical provisions. 
This value shall only be reported where the split between R0461 to R0483 can be 
derived from the method used for the calculation. Where the split is not possible 
only R0450 shall be filled in.  
R0462/C0020  Initial absolute values before 
shock – Assets – spread risk – 
securitisation positions – non- 
senior STS securitisation  This is the absolute value of the assets sensitive to the spread risk on non-senior 
STS securitisation positions. 
Recoverables from reinsurance and SPVs shall not be included in this cell.  
R0462/C0030  Initial absolute values before 
shock – Liabilities – spread 
risk – securitisation positions – 
non-senior STS securitisation  This is the absolute value of the liabilities sensitive to the spread risk on non- 
senior STS securitisation positions. 
This value shall only be reported where the split between R0461 to R0483 can be 
derived from the method used for the calculation. Where the split is not possible, 
only R0450 shall be filled in.

 
For the components Loss absorbing capacity of technical provisions and/or deferred taxes when reported as a separate 
component it should be the amount of the loss-absorbing capacity (these amounts should be reported as negative 
values)  
For components calculated using the standard formula this cell represents the gross nSCR. For components calculated 
using the partial internal model, this represents the value considering the future management actions with are embedded 
in the calculation, but not whose which are modelled as a separate component.  
These amounts shall fully consider diversification effects according to Article 304 of Directive 2009/138/EC where 
applicable.  
When applicable, these cells do not include the allocation of the adjustment due to the aggregation of the nSCR of the 
RFF/MAP at entity level.  
Template SR.26.08 shall be reported by ring-fenced fund, matching adjustment portfolio and the remaining part for 
every undertaking under an internal model. For partial internal models, this includes undertakings where a partial 
internal model is applied to a full ring-fenced fund and/or matching adjustment portfolio while the other ring-fenced 
funds and/or matching adjustment portfolios are under the standard formula. This template should be reported for all 
sub-funds of a material RFF/MAP as identified in the second table of S.01.03.  
The template is applicable in relation to RFF/MAP from undertakings consolidated according to Article 335, 
paragraph 1, (a) and (c) of Delegated Regulation (EU) 2015/35, when method 1 (Accounting consolidation–based 
method) is used, either exclusively or in combination with method 2 (Deduction and aggregation method).  
For those undertakings under a partial internal model to which the adjustment due to the aggregation of the nSCR of 
RFF/MAP is applicable, where the entity has MAP or RFF (except those under the scope of Article 304 of Directive 
2009/138/EC) when reporting at the level of the whole undertaking, the nSCR at risk module level and the loss- 
absorbing capacity (LAC) of technical provisions and deferred taxes to be reported shall be calculated as follows:  
— Where the undertaking applies the full adjustment due to the aggregation of the nSCR of the RFF/MAP at entity 
level: the nSCR is calculated as if no RFF and the LAC shall be calculated as the sum of the LAC across all RFF/MAP 
and remaining part,  
— Where the undertaking applies the Simplification at risk sub-module level to aggregate the nSCR of the RFF/MAP at 
entity level the nSCR and LAC are calculated considering a direct summation at sub-module level method,  
— Where the undertaking applies the Simplification at risk module level to aggregate the nSCR of the RFF/MAP at 
entity level the nSCR and LAC are calculated considering a direct summation at module level method.  
The adjustment due to the aggregation of the nSCR of the RFF/MAP at entity level shall be allocated (C0060) to the 
relevant risk modules (i.e. market risk, counterparty default risk, life underwriting risk, health underwriting risk and non- 
life underwriting risk) when calculated according to the standard formula. The amount to be allocated to each relevant 
risk module shall be calculated as follows:EN  5.5.2023 Official Journal of the European Union L 120/1421

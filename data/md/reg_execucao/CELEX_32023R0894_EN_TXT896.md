R0481/C0050  Absolute values after shock – 
Liabilities (after the loss- 
absorbing capacity of technical 
provisions) – spread risk – 
securitisation positions – other 
securitisation)  This is the absolute value of the liabilities sensitive to the spread risk on other 
securitisation positions, after the shock and after the application of the adjustment 
for the loss-absorbing capacity of technical provisions. 
This value shall only be reported where the split between R0461 to R0483 can be 
derived from the method used for the calculation of the SCR for spread risk. 
Where the split is not possible, only R0450 shall be filled in. 
The amount of TP shall be net of reinsurance and SPV recoverables.  
R0481/C0060  Absolute value after shock – 
Net solvency capital 
requirement – spread risk – 
securitisation positions – other 
securitisation  This is the net capital charge for spread risk on other securitisation positions, after 
the application of the adjustment for the loss-absorbing capacity of technical 
provisions. 
This value shall only be reported where the split between R0461 to R0483 can be 
derived from the method used for the calculation of the SCR for spread risk. 
Where the split is not possible, only R0450 shall be filled in.  
R0481/C0070  Absolute values after shock – 
Liabilities (before the loss- 
absorbing capacity of technical 
provisions)– spread risk – 
securitisation positions – other 
securitisation  This is the absolute value of the liabilities sensitive to the spread risk on other 
securitisation positions, after the shock but before the application of the 
adjustment for the loss-absorbing capacity of technical provisions. 
This value shall only be reported where the split between R0461 to R0483 can be 
derived from the method used for the calculation of the SCR for spread risk. 
Where the split is not possible, only R0450 shall be filled in. 
The amount of TP shall be net of reinsurance and SPV recoverables.  
R0481/C0080  Absolute value after shock – 
Gross solvency capital 
requirement – spread risk – 
securitisation positions – other 
securitisation  This is the gross capital charge for spread risk on other securitisation positions, i. 
e. before the application of the adjustment for the loss-absorbing capacity of 
technical provisions. 
This value shall only be reported where the split between R0461 to R0483 can be 
derived from the method used for the calculation of the SCR for spread risk. 
Where the split is not possible, only R0450 shall be filled in.  
R0482/C0020  Initial absolute values before 
shock – Assets – spread risk – 
securitisation positions – tran ­
sitional type 1 securitisation  This is the absolute value of the assets sensitive to the spread risk on transitional 
type 1 securitisation positions. 
Recoverables from reinsurance and SPVs shall not be included in this cell.  
R0482/C0030  Initial absolute values before 
shock – Liabilities – spread 
risk – securitisation positions – 
transitional type 1 securiti ­
sation  This is the absolute value of the liabilities sensitive to the spread risk on transi ­
tional type 1 securitisation positions. 
This value shall only be reported where the split between R0461 to R0483 can be 
derived from the method used for the calculation of the SCR for spread risk. 
Where the split is not possible, only R0450 shall be filled in.

C0180/R0400  Best estimate Premium Provi ­
sions, Cash in–flows, Other 
cash–in flows (incl. 
recoverables from salvages and 
subrogations) – Total  The total amount of Other cash–in flows (including recoverables from salvages 
and subrogations) used to determine the gross best estimate of premium provi ­
sions.

C0170/R0410  Best estimate Claims Provi ­
sions, Cash out–flows, future 
benefits and claims  The amount of split, for each line of business, as defined in Annex I to Delegated 
Regulation (EU) 2015/35, regarding direct business and accepted proportional 
reinsurance and Accepted non–proportional reinsurance, of cash flows for 
future benefits and claims used to determine the gross best estimate of Claims 
provisions, i.e. the probability–weighted average of future cash out–flows, 
discounted to take into account the time value of money (expected present 
value of future cash–flows). In case of use of a stochastic methodology for the 
cash–flow projection, it is required to report the average scenario.

reinsurance and accepted non–proportional reinsurance, of cash flows for future 
premiums used to determine the gross best estimate of claims provisions, i.e. the

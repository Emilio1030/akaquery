S.12.02 – Life and Health SLT Technical Provisions – by Country  
General comments:  
This section relates to annual submission of information for individual entities. The template is not due when the 
thresholds for reporting by country described below are not applicable, i.e. the home country represents 100 % of the 
sum of the technical provisions calculated as a whole and gross best estimate. When this amount is higher than 90 % 
but lower than 100 % only R0010, R0020 and R0030 shall be reported.  
Undertakings shall take into account all the obligations in different currencies and convert them into the reporting 
currency.  
The information by country shall be reported according to the following specifications:  
a) Information on the home country shall be always reported regardless of the amount of technical provisions 
calculated as a whole and gross best estimate;  
b) Information reported by country shall at least represent 90 % of the sum of the technical provisions calculated as a 
whole and gross best estimate of any line of business, as defined in Annex I to Delegated Regulation (EU) 2015/35;  
c) If a specific country has to be reported for a particular line of business to comply with sub–paragraph b) then that 
country shall be reported for all lines of business;  
d) The other countries shall be reported aggregated in ‘other–EEA’ or ‘other–non-EEA’  
e) For direct business information shall be reported by country where the contract was entered into;  
f) For proportional and non–proportional reinsurance information shall be reported by country of localisation of the 
ceding undertaking.  
For the purposes of this template ‘country where the contract was entered into’ means:  
a) The country where the insurance undertaking is established (home country) when the contract was not sold through 
a branch or freedom to provide services;  
b) The country where the branch is located (host country) when the contract was sold through a branch;EN  5.5.2023 Official Journal of the European Union L 120/721

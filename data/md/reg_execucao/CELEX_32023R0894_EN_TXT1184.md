 
On the table Information on assets, each asset shall be reported separately, with one row for each asset, filling in all 
applicable variables requested in that table.  
The template is applicable for method 1 (Accounting consolidation –based method), method 2 (Deduction and aggre ­
gation method) and a combination of methods 1 and 2.  
Where method 1 is used exclusively, the reporting shall reflect the consolidated position of the assets net of intra–group 
transactions held. The reporting shall be made as follows:  
— Item ‘Legal name of the undertaking – C0010’ and ‘Identification code of the undertaking – C0020’ shall not be 
reported;  
— The assets held by the participating insurance and reinsurance undertakings or insurance holding companies or 
mixed–financial holding companies shall be reported item by item;  
— The assets held by undertakings consolidated in accordance with Article 335, paragraph 1, (a), (b) and (c) of 
Delegated Regulation (EU) 2015/35 shall be reported item by item;  
— Participations in undertakings consolidated in accordance with Article 335, paragraph 1, (d), (e) and (f) of Delegated 
Regulation (EU) 2015/35 shall be reported in one row and identify it by using the available options in cell C0310.  
Where method 2 is used exclusively, the reporting shall include the detailed list of the assets held by the participating 
undertakings, the insurance holding companies and subsidiaries and one row for each non–controlled participation. The 
assets reported shall not take into account the proportional share used for group solvency calculation. The reporting 
shall be made as follows:  
— Item ‘Legal name of the undertaking – C0010’ and ‘Identification code of the undertaking – C0020’ shall be 
reported;  
— The assets held by the participating insurance and reinsurance undertakings or insurance holding companies or 
mixed–financial holding companies shall be reported item by item;  
— The assets held by insurance and reinsurance undertakings, insurance holding companies, ancillary services under ­
takings and special purpose vehicle which are subsidiaries (European Economic Area, equivalent non–European 
Economic Area and non–equivalent non–European Economic Area) shall be reported item by item by undertaking;  
— Participations in insurance and reinsurance undertakings, insurance holding companies, ancillary services under ­
takings and special purpose vehicle which are not subsidiaries (European Economic Area, equivalent non–European 
Economic Area and non–equivalent non–European Economic Area) shall be reported in one row for each partici ­
pation;  
— The assets held by undertakings from the other financial sectors shall not be included.  
Where a combination of methods 1 and 2 is used, one part of the reporting reflects the consolidated position of the 
assets, net of intra–group transactions, which must be reported and the other part of the reporting shall include the 
detailed list of the assets held by the participating undertakings, the insurance holding companies or mixed–financial 
holding companies and subsidiaries and one row for each non–controlled participation, net of intra–group transactions 
and regardless of the proportional share used.EN  L 120/1184 Official Journal of the European Union 5.5.2023

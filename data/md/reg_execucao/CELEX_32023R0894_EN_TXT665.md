This template comprises two tables: Information on positions held and Information on assets.  
On the table Information on positions held, each asset shall be reported separately in as many lines as needed in order 
to properly fill in all non-monetary variables with the exception of item ‘Quantity’, requested in that table. If for the 
same asset two values can be attributed to one variable, then this asset needs to be reported in more than one line.  
On the table Information on assets, each asset shall be reported separately, with one row for each asset, filling in all 
applicable variables requested in that table.  
The information regarding the external rating (C0320) and nominated External Credit Assessment Institutions (ECAI) 
(C0330) may be limited (not reported) in the following circumstances:  
a) through a decision of the national supervisory authority (‘NSA’) under Article 35(6) and (7) of Directive 
2009/138/EC; or  
b) through a decision of the national supervisory authority in the cases where the insurance and reinsurance under ­
takings have in place outsourcing arrangements in the area of investments that lead to this specific information not 
being available directly to the undertaking

reinsurers’ share  Administrative expenses incurred by the undertaking during the reporting period, 
on accrual basis are expenses which are connected with policy administration 
including expenses in respect of reinsurance contracts and special purpose 
vehicles. Some administrative expenses relate directly to activity regarding a 
specific insurance contract (e.g. maintenance cost) such as cost of premium 
billing, cost of sending regular information to policyholders and cost of 
handling policy changes (e.g. conversions and reinstatements). Other adminis ­
trative expenses relate directly to insurance activity but are a result of activities 
that cover more than one policy such as salaries of staff responsible for policy 
administration. 
The amount relates to the reinsurer’s share. 
Reinsurers’ share shall by default be allocated by type of expenses, if not possible 
shall be reported as acquisition expenses.

management expenses could include expenses of recordkeeping of the invest ­
ments’ portfolio, salaries of staff responsible for investment, remunerations of 
external advisers, expenses connected with investment trading activity (i.e. 
buying and selling of the portfolio securities) and in some cases also remuneration 
for custodial services.

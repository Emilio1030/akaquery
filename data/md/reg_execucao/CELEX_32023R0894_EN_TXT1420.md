S.26.08 – Solvency Capital Requirement – for groups using an internal model (partial or full)  
General comments:  
This section relates to the annual submission of information for groups, ring fenced-funds, matching adjustment 
portfolios and remaining part.  
This template shall be reported based on availability of data according to the internal model architecture and risk profile 
when possible with reasonable effort. The data to be reported shall be agreed between national supervisory authorities 
and groups.  
The purpose of this template is to collect data on an aggregate level and show diversification benefits between separate 
risk modules. Some entries are taken from other templates but are indicated below. From a technical perspective these 
are not duplicated as they are essentially the same datapoints. Therefore, by filling data in one template it automatically 
appears in the other one.  
Partial internal models:  
All rows for C0010 refer to the amount of the capital charge for each component regardless of the method of 
calculation (either standard formula or partial internal model), after the adjustments for loss-absorbing capacity of 
technical provision and/or deferred taxes when they are embedded in the component calculation.EN  L 120/1420 Official Journal of the European Union 5.5.2023

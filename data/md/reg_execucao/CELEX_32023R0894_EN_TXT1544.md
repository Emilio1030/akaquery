If the method 1 is applied, the contribution of a subsidiary undertaking to the 
group SCR shall be calculated according to the formula: 
Contrj = SCRj × SCRdiversified/ Σi SCRisolo 
Where: 
— SCRj is the SCR at individual entity level of the undertaking j; 
— SCRdiversified = SCR calculated in accordance to Article 336(a) of Delegated 
Regulation (EU) 2015/35; 
— SCRisolo is the SCR at individual entity level of the participating undertaking 
and each related insurance or 
reinsurance undertaking and third-country insurance and reinsurance undertaking 
included in the calculation of the SCRdiversified; 
— the ratio is the proportional adjustment due to the recognition of diversifi ­
cation effects at group level. 
For related insurance and reinsurance undertakings which are not subsidiaries (art 
335 1.d of the DR) included via method 1, the contribution of the related 
undertaking to the group SCR is the proportional share of the individual SCR. 
For method 2, the contribution of the related undertaking to the group SCR is the 
proportional share of the individual SCR.

 
S.31.02 – Special Purpose Vehicles  
General comments:  
This section relates to the annual submission of information for groups.  
This template is relevant for each group transferring risk(s) to a Special Purpose Vehicle (SPV), to ensure sufficient 
disclosure has been made where SPVs are used as alternative risk transfer methods to traditional reinsurance treaties.  
The template applies to the use of:  
a) SPVs defined under Article 13(26) and authorised under Article 211(1) of Directive 2009/138/EC;  
b) SPVs meeting conditions of Article 211(3) of Directive 2009/138/EC;  
c) SPVs regulated by third country supervisors where these meet equivalent measures to the conditions set out in 
Article 211(2) of Directive 2009/138/EC;  
d) Other SPVs, not meeting the definitions above, where risks are transferred under arrangements with the economic 
substance of a reinsurance contract.  
The template covers risk mitigation techniques (recognised or not) carried out by the (re)insurance undertaking within 
the scope of group supervision whereby a SPV assumes risks from the undertaking within the scope of group super ­
vision through a reinsurance contract; or assume insurance risks from the undertaking within the scope of group 
supervision transferred through a similar arrangement that is ‘reinsurance like’.  
This template shall include data of special purpose vehicles to which the participating insurance or reinsurance under ­
taking or one of its insurance or reinsurance subsidiaries has transferred risk.

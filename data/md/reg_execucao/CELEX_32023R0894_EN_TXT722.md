S.13.01 – Projection of future gross cash flows (Best Estimate –life)  
General comments:  
This part of Annex II relates to annual submission of information for individual entities.  
This template shall include information only in relation to the best estimates. The cash flows to be reported are gross of 
reinsurance and undiscounted.  
Cash–flow projections such as central scenarios can be used as no perfect reconciliation with Best Estimate calculation is 
required. Undertakings may follow different approaches to identify Future Discretionary Benefits, e.g. using the certainty 
equivalent scenario or an average through all the scenarios considered. If difficult to project some future cash–flows like 
collective Future Discretionary Benefits the undertaking shall report the cash flow it effectively uses for calculating the 
Best Estimate. Other example of complex projection are reinsurance contracts covering multiple lines of business. In this 
case, allocation of reinsurance cash-flows by line of business should be consistent with the approach followed to 
unbundle insurance recoverables by line of business.EN  L 120/722 Official Journal of the European Union 5.5.2023

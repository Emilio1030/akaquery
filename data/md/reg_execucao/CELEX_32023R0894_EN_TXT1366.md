sation positions – transi ­
tional type 1 securiti ­
sation  This is the absolute value of the liabilities sensitive to the spread risk on transi ­
tional type 1 securitisation positions. 
This value shall only be reported where the split between R0461 to R0483 can be 
derived from the method used for the calculation. Where the split is not possible, 
only R0450 shall be filled in. 
The amount of TP shall be net of reinsurance and SPV recoverables.

the adjustment for the loss-absorbing capacity of technical provisions. 
This value shall only be reported where the split between R0461 to R0483 can be 
derived from the method used for the calculation. Where the split is not possible,

sation  This is the net capital charge for spread risk on transitional type 1 securitisation 
positions, after application of the adjustment for the loss-absorbing capacity of 
technical provisions. 
This value shall only be reported where the split between R0461 to R0483 can be 
derived from the method used for the calculation. Where the split is not possible, 
only R0450 shall be filled in.

the loss-absorbing 
capacity of technical

ritisation  This is the absolute value of the liabilities sensitive to the spread risk on transi ­
tional type 1 securitisation positions, after the shock but before the application of 
the adjustment for the loss-absorbing capacity of technical provisions. 
This value shall only be reported where the split between R0461 to R0483 can be 
derived from the method used for the calculation. Where the split is not possible, 
only R0450 shall be filled in.

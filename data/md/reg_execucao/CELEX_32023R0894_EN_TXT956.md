 
Regarding the top 10 exposures, each are required in two metrics:  
— ‘group’, i.e. exposure ranking among groups of connected counterparties  
— ‘single’, i.e. counterparties stand alone  
Example: An undertaking A has the following contractual relations with undertakings of an insurance group G. And A 
is not part of group G: (1) A has a reinsurance contract with undertaking R in group G, (2) A holds shares of the paid in 
capital for R and (3) A holds a loan issued by a life insurer L in group G in its asset portfolio. The blocks ‘group’ would 
show the three exposures combined. The blocks ‘single’ would show those separately: (1) and (2) combined for 
counterparty R and (3) for counterparty L.

Top 10 exposures in terms of impact on SCR (group)  
C0010/R0030- 
R0120  Name Group Exposure  Names of the top 10 exposures of groups of counterparties in terms of impact on 
the SCR. 
The impact on SCR is in the column ‘Credit Risk Contribution ’, which should be 
the contribution to the credit SCR, i.e. incl. diversification and the sum of entries 
in the column gives the credit risk SCR.

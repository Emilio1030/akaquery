R0483/C0060  Absolute value after 
shock – Net solvency 
capital requirement – 
spread risk – securiti ­
sation positions – guar ­
anteed STS securitisation  This is the net capital charge for spread risk on guaranteed STS securitisation 
positions, after the application of the adjustment for the loss-absorbing capacity of 
technical provisions. 
This value shall only be reported where the split between R0461 to R0483 can be 
derived from the method used for the calculation. Where the split is not possible, 
only R0450 shall be filled in.  
R0483/C0070  Absolute values after 
shock – Liabilities (before 
the loss-absorbing 
capacity of technical 
provisions)– spread risk – 
securitisation positions – 
guaranteed STS securiti ­
sation  This is the absolute value of the liabilities sensitive to the spread risk on guar ­
anteed STS securitisation positions, after the shock but before the application of 
the adjustment for the loss-absorbing capacity of technical provisions. 
This value shall only be reported where the split between R0461 to R0483 can be 
derived from the method used for the calculation. Where the split is not possible, 
only R0450 shall be filled in. 
The amount of TP shall be net of reinsurance and SPV recoverables.  
R0483/C0080  Absolute value after 
shock – Gross solvency 
capital requirement – 
spread risk – securiti ­
sation positions – guar ­
anteed STS securitisation  This is the gross capital charge for spread risk on guaranteed STS securitisation 
positions, i.e. before the application of the adjustment for the loss-absorbing 
capacity of technical provisions. 
This value shall only be reported where the split between R0461 to R0483 can be 
derived from the method used for the calculation. Where the split is not possible, 
only R0450 shall be filled in.  
Concentration risk  
R0500/C0020  Initial absolute values 
before shock – Assets – 
market risk concentra ­
tions  This is the absolute value of the asset sensitive to the market risk concentrations 
For captive undertakings within the scope of group supervision, if 
R0040/C0010 = 1, this item represents the absolute value of the assets 
sensitive to the market risk concentration, after taking into account simplifications 
allowed for captives. 
Recoverables from reinsurance and SPVs shall not be included in this cell.  
R0500/C0060  Absolute value after 
shock – Net solvency 
capital requirement – 
market risk concentra ­
tions  This is the net capital charge for market risk concentrations, after adjustment for 
the loss absorbing capacity of technical provisions, aggregated for each single 
name exposure. 
For captive undertakings within the scope of group supervision, if cell 
R0040/C0010 = 1, this item represents net capital charge for market risk concen ­
tration, calculated using simplified calculation.EN  L 120/1368 Official Journal of the European Union 5.5.2023

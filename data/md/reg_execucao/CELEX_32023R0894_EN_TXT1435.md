STAND ALONE MARKET AND CREDIT RISK: Sensitivities & exposure data  
C0310-C0360/ 
R0210  Exposure sensitive to 
interest rates – base 
case/no shock  Solvency II value in the Solvency II balance sheet at the key date of the exposure as 
specified above and subject to interest rate risk.  
C0310-C0360/ 
R0220  Interest Rates (parallel 
shift all maturities) by 
– 100bps  Solvency II value of the exposure subject to interest rate risk as specified above but 
under the scenario of a parallel – 100 bps shift on interest rates for all maturities. This 
shift impacts all maturities not only those before the ‘last liquid point’ (LLP).  
C0310-C0360/ 
R0230  Interest Rates (parallel 
shift all maturities) by 
+ 100bps  Solvency II value of the exposure subject to interest rate risk as specified above but 
under the scenario of a parallel + 100 bps shift on interest rates for all maturities. Please 
note that this shift impacts all maturities not only those before the ‘last liquid point’ 
(LLP).  
C0310-C0360/ 
R0240  Interest Rates (parallel 
shift all maturities) by 
– 50bps  Solvency II value of the exposure subject to interest rate risk as specified above but 
under the scenario of a parallel – 50 bps shift on interest rates for all maturities. Please 
note that this shift impacts all maturities not only those before the ‘last liquid point’ 
(LLP).  
C0310-C0360/ 
R0250  Interest Rates (parallel 
shift all maturities) by 
+ 50bps  Solvency II value of the exposure subject to interest rate risk as specified above but 
under the scenario of a parallel + 50 bps shift on interest rates for all maturities. Please 
note that this shift impacts all maturities not only those before the ‘last liquid point’ 
(LLP).  
C0310-C0360/ 
R0260  Exposure sensitive to 
inflation rates – base 
case/no shock  Solvency II value in the Solvency II balance sheet at the key date of the exposure as 
specified above and subject to inflation risk.  
C0310-C0360/ 
R0270  Inflation rates – 100bps  Solvency II value of the exposure subject to inflation risk as specified above but under 
the scenario of a decrease of – 100 bps on inflation rates. 
This sensitivity should be applied in line with the internal models definition and 
allocation of inflation risk.EN  5.5.2023 Official Journal of the European Union L 120/1435

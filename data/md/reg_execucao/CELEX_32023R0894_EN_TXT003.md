Article 2  
Reporting currency  
1. Unless otherwise required by the supervisory authority for the purposes of this Implementing Regulation, 
reporting currency, shall be the following currency:  
(a) for individual reporting, the currency used for the preparation of the insurance or reinsurance undertaking’s financial 
statements;  
(b) for group reporting, the currency used for the preparation of the consolidated financial statements.  
2. Data points with the data type ‘monetary’ shall be reported in the reporting currency, which requires the 
conversion of any other currency into the reporting currency unless otherwise provided for in Annex II and III of 
this Implementing Regulation.  
3. When expressing the value of any asset or liability denominated in another currency than the reporting currency, 
insurance and reinsurance undertakings, captive insurance and captive reinsurance undertakings, participating under ­
takings, insurance holding companies and mixed financial holding companies shall convert the value into the reporting 
currency as if the conversion had taken place at the closing rate of the last day for which the appropriate rate was 
available in the reporting period to which the asset or liability relates.  
4. When expressing the value of any income or expense, insurance and reinsurance undertakings, captive insurance 
and captive reinsurance undertakings, participating undertakings, insurance holding companies and mixed financial 
holding companies shall convert that value into the reporting currency using the same basis of conversion as that 
used for accounting purposes.  
5. When expressing the values of historical data denominated in a currency other than the reporting currency, such 
values related to previous reporting periods shall be converted into the reporting currency based on the closing rate on 
the last day of the period being reported for which the conversion rate is available.  
6. Unless otherwise required by the supervisory authority, the conversion into the reporting currency shall be 
calculated by applying the exchange rate from the same source as the one used for the insurance or reinsurance 
undertaking’s financial statements in the case of individual reporting, or the same source used for the consolidated 
financial statements in the case of group reporting

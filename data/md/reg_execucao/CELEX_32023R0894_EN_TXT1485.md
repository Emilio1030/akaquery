Diversification between 
sub–modules  Diversification effect arising from the aggregation of the risk mitigation effect of 
the group’s specific reinsurance contracts and special purpose vehicles relating to 
different sub–modules (Natural catastrophe, Non–proportional property 
reinsurance, Man–made and ‘Other non–life’ catastrophe risks).  
C0020/R0210  Total risk mitigation – 
Total Non–life catas ­
trophe risk after diver ­
sification  This is the total risk mitigation effect of the group’s specific reinsurance contracts 
and special purpose vehicles arising from all the sub–modules (Natural catas ­
trophe, Non–proportional property reinsurance, Man–made and ‘Other non–life’ 
catastrophe risks), taking into consideration the diversification effect between the 
sub–modules given in C0020/R0200.  
C0030/R0190  SCR after risk mitigation 
– Total Non–life catas ­
trophe risk before diver ­
sification  This is the total catastrophe risk after risk mitigation arising from all the sub– 
modules (Natural catastrophe, Non–proportional property reinsurance, Man–made 
and ‘Other non–life’ catastrophe risks), before the diversification effect between the 
sub–modules.  
C0030/R0200  SCR after risk mitigation 
– Diversification between 
sub–modules  Diversification effect arising from the aggregation of the total capital charges after 
risk mitigation relating to different sub–modules (Natural catastrophe, Non– 
proportional property reinsurance, Man–made and ‘Other non–life’ catastrophe 
risks).  
C0030/R0210  SCR after risk mitigation 
– Total Non–life catas ­
trophe risk after diver ­
sification  This is the total catastrophe risk after risk mitigation arising from all the sub– 
modules (Natural catastrophe, Non–proportional property reinsurance, Man–made 
and ‘Other non–life’ catastrophe risks), taking into consideration the diversification 
effect between the sub–modules given in item C0030/R0200.  
Health catastrophe risk 
– Summary  
C0010/R0300  SCR before risk miti ­
gation – Health catas ­
trophe risk  This is the total catastrophe risk before risk mitigation arising from all Health 
catastrophe risk sub–modules and taking into consideration the diversification 
effect between the sub–modules given in C0010/R0340.  
C0010/R0310 – 
R0330  SCR before risk miti ­
gation – Health catas ­
trophe risk sub–modules  This is the total capital requirement before risk mitigation per Health catastrophe 
risk sub–modules, taking into consideration the diversification effect between the 
countries. 
Per Health catastrophe risk sub–module this amount is equal to the Catastrophe 
Risk Charge before risk mitigation.EN  5.5.2023 Official Journal of the European Union L 120/1485

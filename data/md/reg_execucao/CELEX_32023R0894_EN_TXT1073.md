2015/35, of life insurance a selection shall be made of the 20 largest facultative 
reinsurance exposures (part of sum insured transferred to all reinsurers) overall 
plus the largest two in each line of business if not covered by the 20 largest in 
terms of exposure that are subject to facultative reinsurance in force in the 
reporting period (also if they originated in preceding years). The code is a 
unique identifying number assigned by the insurer that identifies the risk within 
the branch, and this code cannot be reused for other risks in the same branch and 
shall remain unchanged for subsequent annual reports. 
This code once assigned shall not be reused for another risk even when the risk to 
which the code was originally assigned does not exist anymore. 
When one risk affects more than one line of business the same code can be used 
for all the lines of business affected.

R0610–R0620/ 
C0050  Absolute values after 
shock – Liabilities (after 
the loss absorbing 
capacity of technical 
provisions) – Currency 
risk – increase/decrease 
in the value of the 
foreign currency  This is the absolute value of liabilities (after the loss absorbing capacity of 
technical provisions) sensitive to currency increase/decrease risk after the shock. 
The amount of TP shall be net of reinsurance and SPV recoverables.  
R0610–R0620/ 
C0060  Absolute value after 
shock – Net solvency 
capital requirement (after 
the loss absorbing 
capacity of technical 
provisions) – Currency 
risk – increase/decrease 
in the value of the 
foreign currency  This is the net capital charge for currency increase/decrease risk, after adjustment 
for the loss absorbing capacity of technical provisions. In R0610 only the 
currencies where the increase shock is the largest shall be reported and in 
R0620 only the currencies where the decrease shock is the largest shall be 
reported.  
R0610–R0620/ 
C0070  Absolute values after 
shock (before the loss– 
absorbing capacity of 
technical provisions) – 
Currency risk – increase/ 
decrease in the value of 
the foreign currency  This is the absolute value of liabilities (before the loss absorbing capacity of 
technical provisions) sensitive to currency increase/decrease risk after the shock. 
The amount of TP shall be net of reinsurance and SPV recoverables.  
R0610–R0620/ 
C0080  Absolute value after 
shock – Gross solvency 
capital requirement 
(excluding the loss– 
absorbing capacity of 
technical provisions) – 
Currency risk – increase/ 
decrease in the value of 
the foreign currency  This is the gross capital charge for the currency increase/decrease risk, i.e. 
excluding the loss absorbing capacity of Technical provisions. In R0610 only 
the currencies where the increase shock is the largest shall be reported and in 
R0620 only the currencies where the decrease shock is the largest shall be 
reported.  
Diversification within 
market risk module  
R0700/C0060  Diversification within 
market risk module –net  This is the diversification effect within the market risk module as a result of the 
aggregation of the net capital requirements (after loss absorbing capacity of 
technical provisions) of the single risk sub–modules. 
Diversification shall be reported as a negative value when it reduces the capital 
requirement.EN  L 120/1370 Official Journal of the European Union 5.5.2023

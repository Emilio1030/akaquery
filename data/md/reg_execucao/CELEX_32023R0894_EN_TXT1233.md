 
On the table Information on positions held, each asset held as collateral shall be reported separately in as many rows as 
needed in order to properly fill in all variables requested in that table. If for the same asset two values can be attributed 
to one variable, then this asset needs to be reported in more than one line. Real estate held as collateral of the 
mortgages related to individuals shall be reported in one single line.  
On the table Information on assets, each asset held as collateral shall be reported separately, with one row for each

collateral’ (C0060) and ‘Name of the group of the counterparty pledging the collateral’ (C0070) relate to information on

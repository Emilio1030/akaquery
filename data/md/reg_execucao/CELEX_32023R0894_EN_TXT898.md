R0483/C0030  Initial absolute values before 
shock – Liabilities – spread 
risk – securitisation positions – 
guaranteed STS securitisation  This is the absolute value of the liabilities sensitive to the spread risk on guar ­
anteed STS securitisation positions. 
This value shall only be reported where the split between R0461 to R0483 can be 
derived from the method used for the calculation of the SCR for spread risk. 
Where the split is not possible, only R0450 shall be filled in. 
The amount of TP shall be net of reinsurance and SPV recoverables.  
R0483/C0040  Absolute values after shock – 
Assets – spread risk – secu ­
ritisation positions – guar ­
anteed STS securitisation  This is the absolute value of the assets sensitive to the spread risk on guaranteed 
STS securitisation positions, after the shock. 
Recoverables from reinsurance and SPVs shall not be included in this cell.  
R0483/C0050  Absolute values after shock – 
Liabilities (after the loss- 
absorbing capacity of technical 
provisions) – spread risk – 
securitisation positions – 
guaranteed STS securitisation  This is the absolute value of the liabilities sensitive to the spread risk on guar ­
anteed STS securitisation positions, after the shock and after the application of the 
adjustment for the loss-absorbing capacity of technical provisions. 
This value shall only be reported where the split between R0461 to R0483 can be 
derived from the method used for the calculation of the SCR for spread risk. 
Where the split is not possible, only R0450 shall be filled in. 
The amount of TP shall be net of reinsurance and SPV recoverables.  
R0483/C0060  Absolute value after shock – 
Net solvency capital 
requirement – spread risk – 
securitisation positions – 
guaranteed STS securitisation  This is the net capital charge for spread risk on guaranteed STS securitisation 
positions, after the application of the adjustment for the loss-absorbing capacity of 
technical provisions. 
This value shall only be reported where the split between R0461 to R0483 can be 
derived from the method used for the calculation of the SCR for spread risk. 
Where the split is not possible, only R0450 shall be filled in.  
R0483/C0070  Absolute values after shock – 
Liabilities (before the loss- 
absorbing capacity of technical 
provisions)– spread risk – 
securitisation positions – 
guaranteed STS securitisation  This is the absolute value of the liabilities sensitive to the spread risk on guar ­
anteed STS securitisation positions, after the shock but before the application of 
the adjustment for the loss-absorbing capacity of technical provisions. 
This value shall only be reported where the split between R0461 to R0483 can be 
derived from the method used for the calculation of the SCR for spread risk. 
Where the split is not possible, only R0450 shall be filled in. 
The amount of TP shall be net of reinsurance and SPV recoverables.  
R0483/C0080  Absolute value after shock – 
Gross solvency capital 
requirement – spread risk – 
securitisation positions – 
guaranteed STS securitisation  This is the gross capital charge for spread risk on guaranteed STS securitisation 
positions, i.e. before the application of the adjustment for the loss-absorbing 
capacity of technical provisions. 
This value shall only be reported where the split between R0461 to R0483 can be 
derived from the method used for the calculation of the SCR for spread risk. 
Where the split is not possible, only R0450 shall be filled in.EN  L 120/898 Official Journal of the European Union 5.5.2023

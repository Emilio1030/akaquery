 
— Where the undertaking applies the full adjustment due to the aggregation of the nSCR of the RFF/MAP at entity level 
the nSCR is calculated as if no loss of diversification exists and the LAC shall be calculated as the sum of the LAC 
across all RFF/MAP and remaining part;  
— Where the undertaking applies the Simplification at risk sub–module level to aggregate the nSCR of the RFF/MAP at 
entity level the nSCR is calculated considering a direct summation at sub–module level method and the LAC shall be 
calculated as the sum of the LAC across all RFF/MAP and remaining part;  
— Where the undertaking applies the simplification at risk module level to aggregate the nSCR of the RFF/MAP at 
entity level the nSCR is calculated considering a direct summation at module level method and the LAC shall be 
calculated as the sum of the LAC across all RFF/MAP and remaining part.  
The adjustment due to the aggregation of the nSCR of the RFF/MAP at entity level shall be allocated (C0050) to the 
relevant risk modules (i.e. market risk, counterparty default risk, life underwriting risk, health underwriting risk and 
non–life underwriting risk). The amount to be allocated to each relevant risk module shall be calculated as follows: 
Calculation of q factor  ¼  adjustment 
BSCR ′ Ä  nSCR  int 
where 
—  adjustment  =  Adjustment calculated according to one of the three methods 
referred above  
—  BSCR’  =  Basic solvency capital requirement calculated according to the 
information reported in this template (C0040/R0100)  
—  nSCR  int = nSCR for intangible assets risk according to the information reported 
in this template (C0040/R0070)  
— Multiplication of this ‘q factor’ by the nSCR of each relevant risk module (i.e. market risk, counterparty default risk, 
life underwriting risk, health underwriting risk and non–life underwriting risk)  
For group reporting the following specific requirements shall be met:  
a) The information until R0460 is applicable when method 1 as defined in Article 230 of Directive 2009/138/EC is 
used, either exclusively or in combination with method 2 as defined in Article 233 of Directive 2009/138/EC;  
b) When combination method is being used, the information until R0460 is to be submitted only for the part of the 
group calculated with method 1 as defined in Article 230 of Directive 2009/138/EC.EN  L 120/1328 Official Journal of the European Union 5.5.2023

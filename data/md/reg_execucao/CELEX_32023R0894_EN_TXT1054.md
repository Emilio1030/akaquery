C0050–C0060/ 
R0190  Variation of Best 
Estimate on risk covered 
after the period  It is expected that these cells mainly concerns Non–Life and refers to changes in 
(part of) Premiums Provisions (i.e. in relation to all recognised obligations within 
the boundary of the contract at the valuation date where the claim has not yet 
occurred) as follows: 
— Identify the part of premiums provisions at end of year (N) related to a 
coverage period starting after the closing year end N; 
— Identify the part of premiums provisions at end of Year (N – 1) related to a 
coverage period starting after the closing Year end N; 
Derive the variation from the two figures.  
C0050–C0060/ 
R0200  Variation of Best 
Estimate on risks covered 
during the period  It is expected that these cells mainly concerns Non–Life, and refers to the 
following cases: 
a) (part of) Premiums Provisions at Year end N – 1 which turned to Claims 
Provisions at year end N because claim has occurred during that period 
b) claims provisions related to claims occurred during the period (for which there 
was no Premiums provisions at year end N – 1) 
Calculation may be as follows: 
— Identify the part of claims provisions at Year end (N) related to risks covered 
during the period; 
— Identify the part of premiums provisions at Year end (N – 1) related to risks 
covered during the period; 
Derive the variation from the two figures.  
C0050–C0060/ 
R0210  Variation of Best 
Estimate due to 
unwinding of discount 
rate – risks covered prior 
to period  The concept of unwinding may be illustrated as follows: Calculate the Best 
Estimate of year N–1 again but using the shifted interest rate term structure. 
In order to isolate this strict scope of variation, the calculation may be as follows: 
— Consider part of the Opening Best Estimate related to risks covered prior to 
period, i.e. Opening Best Estimate excluding Premiums provisions but 
including opening adjustments if any (see cells C0050/R0160 to R0180 and 
C0060/R0160 to R0180; 
— Based on this figure, run the calculation of the unwinding of discount rates 
that applied during year N.  
C0050–C0060/ 
R0220  Variation of Best 
Estimate due to year N 
projected in and out 
flows – risks covered 
prior to period  Premiums, claims, and surrenders that were forecasted on the Opening Best 
Estimate (related to risks covered prior to period) as to be paid during the year, 
will not be in the closing Best Estimate anymore as they would have been paid/ 
received during the year. 
A neutralization adjustment has thus to be performed. 
In order to isolate this adjustment, the calculation may be as follows:EN  L 120/1054 Official Journal of the European Union 5.5.2023

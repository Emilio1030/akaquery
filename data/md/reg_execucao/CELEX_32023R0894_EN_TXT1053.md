 
ITEM  INSTRUCTIONS  
— Consider the opening Best Estimate including the adjustment to opening Best 
Estimate (cell C0010/R0010 to R0040) and the impact of unwinding, of year 
N projected cash–flows and experience (C0010/R0060 to R0080 and 
C0020/R0060 to R0080 respectively, or alternatively, C0010/R0060 to 
R0090 and C0020/R0060 to R0090 respectively) 
— Based on this figure, run calculations with new discount rates that applied 
during year N, together with related financial assumptions (if any). 
This will provide the variation of Best Estimate strictly related to changes in 
discount rates and related financial assumptions.  
C0010–C0020/ 
R0110  Other changes not 
elsewhere explained  Corresponds to other variations in Best Estimate, not captured in cells 
C0010/R0010 to R0100 (for Life) or C0020/R0010 to R0100 (Non–Life).

gross of reinsurance  Amount of Best Estimate as stated in the Balance Sheet at closing year N related 
to those lines of business, as defined in Annex I to Delegated Regulation (EU) 
2015/35, for which an underwriting year approach (UWY) is used for Best 
Estimate calculation. 
These cells might be nil (if no UWY approach is used), or might total the closing 
Best Estimate figure in the Balance Sheet if no accident Year approach (AY) is 
used.

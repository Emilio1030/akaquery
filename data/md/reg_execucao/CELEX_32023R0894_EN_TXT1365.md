R0481/C0050  Absolute values after 
shock – Liabilities (after 
the loss-absorbing 
capacity of technical 
provisions) – spread risk 
– securitisation positions 
– other securitisation)  This is the absolute value of the liabilities sensitive to the spread risk on other 
securitisation positions, after the shock and after the application of the adjustment 
for the loss-absorbing capacity of technical provisions. 
This value shall only be reported where the split between R0461 to R0483 can be 
derived from the method used for the calculation. Where the split is not possible 
only R0450 shall be filled in. 
The amount of TP shall be net of reinsurance and SPV recoverables.  
R0481/C0060  Absolute value after 
shock – Net solvency 
capital requirement – 
spread risk – securiti ­
sation positions – other 
securitisation  This is the net capital charge for spread risk on other securitisation positions, after 
the application of the adjustment for the loss-absorbing capacity of technical 
provisions. 
This value shall only be reported where the split between R0461 to R0483 can be 
derived from the method used for the calculation. Where the split is not possible, 
only R0450 shall be filled in.  
R0481/C0070  Absolute values after 
shock – Liabilities (before 
the loss-absorbing 
capacity of technical 
provisions)– spread risk – 
securitisation positions – 
other securitisation  This is the absolute value of the liabilities sensitive to the spread risk on other 
securitisation positions, after the shock but before the application of the 
adjustment for the loss-absorbing capacity of technical provisions. 
This value shall be reported only where the split between R0461 to R0483 can be 
derived from the method used for the calculation. Where the split is not possible 
only R0450 shall be filled in. 
The amount of TP shall be net of reinsurance and SPV recoverables.  
R0481/C0080  Absolute value after 
shock – Gross solvency

securitisation  This is the gross capital charge for spread risk on other securitisation positions, i. 
e. before the application of the adjustment for the loss-absorbing capacity of 
technical provisions. 
This value shall be reported only where the split between R0461 to R0483 can be 
derived from the method used for the calculation. Where the split is not possible, 
only R0450 shall be filled in.  
R0482/C0020  Initial absolute values 
before shock – Assets – 
spread risk – securiti ­
sation positions – transi ­

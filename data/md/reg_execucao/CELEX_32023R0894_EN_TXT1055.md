 
ITEM  INSTRUCTIONS  
— Consider part of the Opening Best Estimate related to risks covered prior to 
period, i.e. Opening Best Estimate excluding Premiums provisions; 
— Isolate the amount of cash flows (cash in minus cash out) that were projected 
within this opening Best Estimate for the period considered; 
— This isolated amount of cash flow shall come in addition to Opening Best 
Estimate (for neutralisation effect) – and be filled in cell C0050 and C0060/ 
R0220.  
C0050–C0060/ 
R0230  Variation of Best 
Estimate due to 
experience – riskscovered 
prior to period  The variation of Best Estimate captured here shall strictly relate to the cash flows 
projected at the end of the period when compared to the cash flows that were 
projected at the beginning of the period for the periods N + 1 and future. 
It shall only capture the changes due to the realisation of the CF in year N and not 
linked to changes in assumptions.  
C0050–C0060/ 
R0240  Variation of Best 
Estimate due to changes 
in non–economic 
assumptions – risks 
covered prior to period  It mainly refers to changes in best estimate not driven by realised technical flows 
and changes in assumptions directly linked to insurance risks (i.e. lapse rates), 
which can be referred to as non–economic assumptions. 
In order to isolate the strict scope of variation due to changes in assumptions, the 
calculation may be as follows: 
Consider the opening Best Estimate (cell C0050-C0060/R0150) including the 
adjustment to opening Best Estimate (cells C0050-C0060/R0160 to R0180) and 
the impact of unwinding of year N projected cash–flows (C0050-C0060/R0210 to 
R0230); 
Based on this figure, run calculations with new assumptions not related to 
discount rates – that applied at year end N (if any); 
This will provide the variation of Best Estimate strictly related to changes in these 
assumptions. This may not capture the variation due to case–by–case revision of 
RBNS, which would thus have to be added. 
For Non–Life, in cases where these changes cannot be discerned separately from 
changes due to experience, report the total figure under C0060/R0230.  
C0050–C0060/ 
R0250  Variation of Best 
Estimate due to changes 
in economic 
environment – risks 
covered prior to period  It mainly refers to assumptions not directly linked to insurance risks, i.e. mainly 
the impact of the changes in economic environment on the cash flows (taking 
management actions into account, e. g. reduction of FDB) and changes in discount 
rates. 
For non–life (C0060/R0250), in case variation due to inflation cannot be 
discerned from changes due to experience, the whole amount would be 
reported under C0060/R0230. 
In order to isolate this strict scope of variation, the calculation may be as follows: 
— Consider the opening Best Estimate including the adjustment to opening Best 
Estimate (cells C0050/R0160 to R0180) and the impact of unwinding, of year 
N projected cash–flows and experience (C0050/R0210 to R0230 and 
C0060/R0210 toR0230 respectively, or alternatively, C0050/R0210 to 
R0240 and C0060/R0210 toR0240, respectively);EN  5.5.2023 Official Journal of the European Union L 120/1055

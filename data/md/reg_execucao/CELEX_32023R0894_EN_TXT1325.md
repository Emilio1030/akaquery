C0850  Total non available own funds 
to be deducted  Total non-available own funds to be deducted at group level. 
In accordance with Article 222(4) of Directive 2009/138/EC, the total non 
available own funds is calculated, undertaking by undertaking, by adding up 
own funds indicated in Article 222(2) of Directive 2009/138/EC (i.e. surplus 
funds and any subscribed but not paid–up capital) and in Article 330 of 
Delegated Regulation (EU) 2015/35 (e.g. ancillary own funds, preferences 
shares, subordinated mutual member account, subordinated liabilities and the 
value of net deferred tax assets). 
The part of such own funds that exceeds the contribution of the related under ­
taking to the group SCR cannot be considered as available for covering the group 
SCR. 
If the total amount of such own funds in C0842 does not exceed the contribution 
of the related undertaking to the group SCR, this deduction in C0850 is not 
needed as part of the calculation.

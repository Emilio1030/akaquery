C0020 to 
C0170/R0440  Best estimate Claims Provi ­
sions, Cash in–flows, Other 
cash–in flows (incl. 
Recoverable from salvages and 
subrogations)  The amount of split, for each line of business, as defined in Annex I to Delegated 
Regulation (EU) 2015/35, regarding direct business and accepted proportional 
reinsurance and accepted non–proportional reinsurance, of other cash–in flows 
(including Recoverable from salvages and subrogations) used to determine the 
gross best estimate of Claims provisions, i.e. the probability–weighted average 
of future cash in–flows, discounted to take into account the time value of 
money (expected present value of future cash–flows). In case of use of a stochastic 
methodology for the cash–flow projection, it is required to report the average 
scenario.  
C0180/R0440  Best estimate Claims Provi ­
sions, Cash in–flows, Other 
cash–in flows (incl. 
Recoverable from salvages and 
subrogations) – Total  The total amount of Claims Provisions, cash in–flows, Other cash–in flows 
(including Recoverable from salvages and subrogations) used to determine the 
gross best estimate of claims provisions.

Estimate calculated using 
approximations  Percentage of gross best estimate included in Total Best Estimate Gross (R0260) 
calculated using approximations as established in Article 21 of Delegated Regu ­

Percentage of gross Best 
Estimate calculated using 
approximations – Total  Percentage of total gross best estimate included in Total Best Estimate Gross 
(R0260) calculated using approximations as established in Article 21 of 
Delegated Regulation (EU) 2015/35, per each Line of Business regarding direct 
business and accepted proportional reinsurance and accepted non–proportional 
reinsurance.  
C0020 to 
C0170/R0460  Best estimate subject to tran ­
sitional of the interest rate  Amount of best estimate reported in R0260 subject to transitional adjustment to 
the relevant risk-free interest rate term structure, for each line of business, as 
defined in Annex I to Delegated Regulation (EU) 2015/35.  
C0180/R0460  Best estimate subject to tran ­
sitional of the interest rate – 
Total Non–Life obligation  Total amount, for all lines of business, as defined in Annex I to Delegated 
Regulation (EU) 2015/35, of Best estimate reported in R0260 subject to transi ­
tional adjustment to the relevant risk-free interest rate term structure.  
C0020 to 
C0170/R0470  Technical provisions without 
transitional of the interest rate  Amount of the technical provisions calculated without the transitional adjustment 
to the relevant risk-free interest rate term structure, for each line of business, as 
defined in Annex I to Delegated Regulation (EU) 2015/35. 
In the cases where the same best estimates were also subject to the volatility 
adjustment, the amount reported in this item shall reflect the value without the 
transitional adjustment to the relevant risk-free interest rate term structure but 
with the volatility adjustment.

sitional adjustment to the relevant risk-free interest rate term structure.

adjustment, the amount reported in this item shall reflect the value without the

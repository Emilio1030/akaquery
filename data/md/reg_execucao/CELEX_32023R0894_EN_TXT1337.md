 
— Where the undertaking applies the full adjustment due to the aggregation of the nSCR of the RFF/MAP at entity 
level: the nSCR is calculated as if no RFF and the LAC shall be calculated as the sum of the LAC across all RFF/MAP 
and remaining part;  
— Where the undertaking applies the Simplification at risk sub-module level to aggregate the nSCR of the RFF/MAP at 
entity level the nSCR and LAC are calculated considering a direct summation at sub-module level method,  
— Where the undertaking applies the Simplification at risk module level to aggregate the nSCR of the RFF/MAP at 
entity level the nSCR and LAC are calculated considering a direct summation at module level method.  
The adjustment due to the aggregation of the nSCR of the RFF/MAP at entity level shall be allocated (C0050) to the 
relevant risk modules (i.e. market risk, counterparty default risk, life underwriting risk, health underwriting risk and non- 
life underwriting risk) when calculated according to the standard formula. The amount to be allocated to each relevant 
risk module shall be calculated as follows:  
—  Calculation of ‘q factor’  ¼  adjustment 
BSCR ′ Ä  nSCR  int , where  
—  adjustment =  Adjustment calculated according to one of the three methods referred above  
—  BSCR' =  Basic solvency capital requirement calculated according to the information reported in this template  
—  nSCR  int = nSCR for intangible assets risk according to the information reported in this template  
— Multiplication of this ‘q factor’ by the nSCR of each relevant risk module (i.e. market risk, counterparty default risk, 
life underwriting risk, health underwriting risk and non-life underwriting risk)  
Full internal model:  
Template SR.25.05 has to be filled in for each ring-fenced fund (RFF), each matching adjustment portfolio (MAP) and 
for the remaining part for every group under a full internal model. However, where an RFF/MAP includes a MAP/RFF 
embedded, the fund should be treated as different funds. This template should be reported for all sub-funds of a material 
RFF/MAP as identified in the second table of S.01.03.  
ITEM  INSTRUCTIONS  
Z0020  Ring-fenced fund, 
matching adjustment 
portfolio or Remaining 
Part  Identifies whether the reported figures are with regard to a RFF, matching adjustment 
portfolio or to the remaining part. One of the options in the following closed list shall 
be used: 
1 – RFF/MAP 
2 – Remaining part  
Z0030  Fund/Portfolio number  When item Z0020 = 1, identification number for a ring-fenced fund or matching 
adjustment portfolio. This number is attributed by the undertaking and must be 
consistent over time and with the fund/portfolio number reported in other templates. 
When item Z0020 = 2, then report ‘0’EN  5.5.2023 Official Journal of the European Union L 120/1337

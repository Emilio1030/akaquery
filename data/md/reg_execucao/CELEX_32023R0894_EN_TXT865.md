S.25.01 – Solvency Capital Requirement – for undertakings on Standard Formula  
General comments:  
This section relates to annual submission of information for individual entities, ring-fenced funds, matching adjustment 
portfolios and remaining part.  
Template SR.25.01 has to be filled in for each ring–fenced fund (RFF), each matching adjustment portfolio (MAP) and 
for the remaining part. However, where a RFF/MAP includes a MAP/RFF embedded, the fund should be treated as 
different funds. This template shall be reported for all sub–funds of a material RFF/MAP as identified in the second table 
of template S.01.03.  
Where the entity has MAP or RFF (except those under the scope of Article 304 of Directive 2009/138/EC) when 
reporting at the level of the whole undertaking, the notional Solvency Capital Requirement (‘nSCR’) at risk module level 
and the loss–absorbing capacity (LAC) of technical provisions and deferred taxes to be reported shall be calculated as 
follows:  
— Where the undertaking applies the full adjustment due to the aggregation of the nSCR of the RFF/MAP at entity level 
the nSCR is calculated as if no loss of diversification exists and the LAC shall be calculated as the sum of the LAC 
across all RFF/MAP and remaining part;  
— Where the undertaking applies the Simplification at risk sub–module level to aggregate the nSCR of the RFF/MAP at 
entity level the nSCR is calculated considering a direct summation at sub–module level method and the LAC shall be 
calculated as the sum of the LAC across all RFF/MAP and remaining part,  
— Where the undertaking applies the simplification at risk module level to aggregate the nSCR of the RFF/MAP at 
entity level the nSCR is calculated considering a direct summation at module level method and the LAC shall be 
calculated as the sum of the LAC across all RFF/MAP and remaining part.  
The adjustment due to the aggregation of the nSCR of the RFF/MAP at entity level shall be allocated (C0050) to the 
relevant risk modules (i.e. market risk, counterparty default risk, life underwriting risk, health underwriting risk and 
non–life underwriting risk). The amount to be allocated to each relevant risk module shall be calculated as follows:  
—  Calculation of q factor  ¼  adjustment 
BSCR ′ Ä  nSCR  int , where  
—  adjustment  = Adjustment calculated according to one of the three methods referred above  
—  BSCR ′ = Basic solvency capital requirement calculated according to the information reported in this 
template (C0040/R0100)  
—  nSCR  int = nSCR for intangible assets risk according to the information reported in this template 
(C0040/R0070)  
— Multiplication of this ‘q factor’ by the nSCR of each relevant risk module (i.e. market risk, counterparty default risk, 
life underwriting risk, health underwriting risk and non–life underwriting risk)EN  5.5.2023 Official Journal of the European Union L 120/865

provisions)– spread risk – 
securitisation positions – rese ­

securitisation  This is the absolute value of the assets sensitive to the spread risk on other

R0481/C0030  Initial absolute values before 
shock – Liabilities – spread 
risk – securitisation positions – 
other securitisation  This is the absolute value of the liabilities sensitive to the spread risk on other

This value shall only be reported where the split between R0461 to R0483 can be 
derived from the method used for the calculation of the SCR for spread risk. 
Where the split is not possible, only R0450 shall be filled in. 
The amount of TP shall be net of reinsurance and SPV recoverables.

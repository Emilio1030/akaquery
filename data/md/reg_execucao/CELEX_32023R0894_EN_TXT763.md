S.18.01 – Projection of future cash flows (Best Estimate – Non Life)  
General Comments:  
This section relates to annual submission of information for individual undertakings.  
This template shall be reported for the material non-life line of business, as defined in Annex I to Delegated Regulation 
(EU) 2015/35, representing a coverage of 90 % of the non-life technical provisions. Line of business shall be reported in 
accordance with the amount of technical provisions, i.e. the line of business with the highest amount of technical 
provisions.  
The negative technical provisions at the level of the line of business shall be considered with absolute value for the 
purpose of the calculation of the materiality of the above thresholds.  
In case the undertaking uses simplifications for the calculation of technical provisions, for which an estimate of the 
expected future cash–flows arising from the contracts are not calculated, the information shall not be reported.  
This template applies only to Best Estimate and the following shall be considered:  
— All cash flows expressed in different currencies shall be considered and converted in the reporting currency using the 
exchange rate at the reporting date;  
— The cash flows shall be reported gross of reinsurance and undiscounted;

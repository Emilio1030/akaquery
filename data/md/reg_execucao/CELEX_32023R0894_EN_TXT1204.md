 
In some cases the types of structured products (C0070) identify the derivative embedded in the structured product. In 
this case this classification shall be used when the structured product has the referred derivative embedded.  
The template is applicable for method 1 (Accounting consolidation –based method), method 2 (Deduction and aggre ­
gation method) and a combination of methods 1 and 2.  
Where method 1 is used exclusively, the reporting shall reflect the consolidated position of the structured notes and 
collateralised securities net of intra–group transactions held within the scope of group supervision in its portfolio. The 
reporting shall be made as follows:  
— Item ‘Legal name of the undertaking – C0010’ and ‘Identification code of the undertaking – C0020’ shall not be 
reported;  
— The structured products held directly by participating insurance and reinsurance undertakings or insurance holding 
companies or mixed–financial holding companies shall be reported item by item;  
— The structured products held by undertakings consolidated in accordance with Article 335, paragraph 1, (a), (b) 
and (c) of Delegated Regulation (EU) 2015/35 shall be reported item by item;  
— The structured products held by other related undertakings shall not be included.  
Where method 2 is used exclusively, the reporting shall include the detailed list of the structured notes and collateralised 
securities held by the participating undertakings, the insurance holding companies or mixed–financial holding 
companies and subsidiaries, and regardless of the proportional share used. The reporting shall be made as follows:  
— Item ‘Legal name of the undertaking – C0010’ and ‘Identification code of the undertaking – C0020’ shall be 
reported;  
— The structured products held directly by participating insurance and reinsurance undertakings or insurance holding 
companies or mixed–financial holding companies shall be reported item by item  
— The structured products held by insurance and reinsurance undertakings, insurance holding companies, ancillary 
services undertakings and special purpose vehicle which are subsidiaries (European Economic Area, equivalent non– 
European Economic Area and non–equivalent non–European Economic Area) shall be reported item by item by 
undertaking;  
— The structured products held by other related undertakings shall not be included.  
Where a combination of methods 1 and 2 is used, one part of the reporting reflects the consolidated position of the 
structured notes and collateralised securities, net of intra–group transactions, held within the scope of group supervision 
which must be reported and the other part of the reporting shall include the detailed list of the structured notes and 
collateralised securities held by the participating undertakings, the insurance holding companies or mixed–financial 
holding companies and subsidiaries, regardless of the proportional share used.EN  L 120/1204 Official Journal of the European Union 5.5.2023

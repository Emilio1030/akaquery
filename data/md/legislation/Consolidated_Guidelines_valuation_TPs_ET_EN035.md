Guideline 37B – Bidirectional assumptions  
When setting the assumptions on dynamic policyholder behaviour, insurance and reinsurance 
undertakings should consider that the dependency on the trigger event and the exercise rate 
of the option is usually bidirectional, i.e. both an increase and a decrease should be considered 
depending on the direction of the trigger event. 
 
Guideline 37C – Option to pay additional or different premiums  
Insurance and reinsurance undertakings should model all relevant contractual options when 
projecting the cash flows, including the option to pay additional premiums or to vary the 
amount of pr emiums to be paid that fall within contract boundaries . 
 
Future management actions  
Guideline 38 – Allowance for future management actions  
Insurance and reinsurance undertakings should be able to provide adequate justification 
where future management action s are ignored on the grounds of materiality.  
 
Guideline 39 – Consistency of management actions with other assumptions  
Insurance and reinsurance undertakings should take into account the impact of assumed 
management actions on other assumptions within a certain valuation scenario. In particular, 
undertakings should take into account the effects of a certain management action on 
policyholder behaviour or on the related expenses. Undertakings should take account of 
relevant legal or regulatory constraints on m anagement action. Moreover, for a given scenario 
undertakings should ensure that the assumed future management actions reflect the balance, 
which is consistent with the corporate planning, between the degree of competitiveness and 
the risk of dynamic lapse s.

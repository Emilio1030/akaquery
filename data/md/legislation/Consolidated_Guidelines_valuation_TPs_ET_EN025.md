Reimbursements of investment management expenses that the fund manager pays to the 
undertaking should be taken into account as oth er incoming cash flows. Where these 
reimbursements are shared with the policyholders or other third parties, the corresponding 
cash out flows should also be considered.  
Explanatory text  
57. Investment management expenses could include administration expenses ( expenses of 
recordkeeping of the investmentsâ€™ portfolio, salaries of staff responsible for investments, 
remunerations of external advisers, expenses connected with an investment trading activity and in some cases also remuneration for custodial services) and trading expenses (buying and selling of the portfolio securities).  
58. In case of most unit linked and index linked products, products managed in ring- fenced 
funds and products to which matching adjustment is applied, the amount of investments related to a  particular product are clearly identified as a consequence of the terms and 
conditions of the contract or requirements from Solvency II framework or other relevant 
regulation. In these cases, undertakings are expected to consider in the best estimate the 
expenses related to these investments.  
59. For products other than those mentioned in point 3.36, neither  the contract terms nor the 
applicable regulatory framework requires to identify the investments, hence insurance and reinsurance undertakings need to determine the amount of investments related to a 
product or obligation. In some cases, insurance and reinsurance undertakings may still be 
able to clearly identify the investments related to a product or obligation as part of their ALM policy, but in other cases it may be necessary to use drivers to estimate the amount of investments related to a product as i f the product were a ring fenced fund. The appropriate 
driver to be used depends on the product or obligation, but since Solvency II framework follows an economic valuation, the Best Estimate might not be an accurate driver (due to EPIFP among others). In some cases, local GAAP technical provisions may be used as drivers, 
e.g. for with profits products where the profit sharing mechanism is linked to local GAAP technical provisions.  
60. When projecting the expense cash flows, insurance and reinsurance undertakings should use assumptions and calculation models that reflect the expense assumptions at the valuation date.  
61. Sometimes the fund manager pays back commissions to the asset manager (often called 
kick-backs). If the kick -backs are left to the undertakings an d not directed further to e.g.

additional information the calculation provides. In these cases, it may be appropriate to 
update the key variables of the calculations (like interest rates) while other variables with 
little influence on the results may be approxima ted.  
127. It can be appropriate to base the simplified calculations of the risk margin to be carried out 
during the year on the risk margin calculated at the beginning of the year. Since no full 
calculations of the SCR are carried out during the year, a possib le simplifications may be to 
fix the risk margin at a given point in time (t) during the forthcoming year (i.e. CoCMlob(t)) basing on the assumption that the ratio of the risk margin to the best estimate technical provisions (net of reinsurance) will stay constant during the year.  
128. The formula for the application of this simplification is described in Technical Annex.  
129. It may be inappropriate to apply this formula in cases where the best estimates are expected to decrease, in relative terms to the business,  e.g. in cases of negative best 
estimates or best estimates close to zero. Furthermore, there may be situations, such as run-off undertakings, that may deserve specific analysis.  
130. Another situation where this approach may not be appropriate is when an unde rtaking’s 
business is expected to strongly increase in the short term, leading to both a lower best estimate (due to allowance for profit at inception) and a higher duration of the obligations: 
in this case, in fact, this simplification leads to a lower risk margin, while an increased risk 
margin would be expected due to the increased duration of the liabilities.  
131. Moreover, the assumption of stability of the SCR to the best estimate over time could not 
be met if the undertaking has commuted a reinsurance tr eaty or when a purchase of a book 
of business causes a change in the proportional split.  
132. Accordingly, in cases where the above simplification is not appropriate, it may be a better 
approximation to let the risk margin stay unchanged during the year (i.e. CoCM(t) = 
CoCM(0)).  
133. A combination of the two approaches described above is also possible, e.g. by fixing the risk 
margin at the beginning of the year as a floor for the risk margin to be used during the year, that is:  
134. CoCM(t) = max{(CoCM(0)/BENet,(0))・BE Net,(t); CoCM(0)}.  
135. In some circumstances, it may be unavoidable for the undertaking to apply a valuation 
method which leads to an increased level of estimation uncertainty in the valuation. This 
could e.g. be the case where there is only insufficient pertinent past experience data 
available to derive or validate assumptions or in case of portfolios with high -severity -low-
frequency claims.

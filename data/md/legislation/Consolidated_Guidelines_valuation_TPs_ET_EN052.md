To demonstrate the robustness of the ESG, insurance and reinsurance undertakings should 
test the sensitivity of the valuation of some typical liabilities to the variation of some 
parameters in the calibration process.  
To demonstrate the market consistency properties of the ESG, at least some of the following 
tests shoul d be carried out on the set of scenarios generated by the ESG used for valuation:  
a) Calibration tests: verify that the requirements set out in Article 22(3) of Commission 
Delegated Regulation 2015/35 are met;  
b) Martingale tests: verify the Martingale test for the asset classes (equity, bonds, property, 
exchange rates, etc.) that have been used in the calibration process of the ESG, and for 
some simple portfolio investment strategies;  
c) Correlation tests: comparison of the simulated correlations with the historical 
correlations.  
Insurance and reinsurance undertakings should ensure that the tests of accuracy, robustness 
and market consistency of the ESG are performed on a regular basis and at least annually.  
 
Guideline 59 – Random and pseudo random number generato rs 
Insurance and reinsurance undertakings should ensure that (pseudo)random number 
generators used in an ESG are properly tested.  
 
Guideline 60 – On-going appropriateness of an ESG  
Insurance and reinsurance undertakings should have adequate procedures in p lace to ensure 
that an ESG remains appropriate for the calculation of the technical provisions on an ongoing 
basis.

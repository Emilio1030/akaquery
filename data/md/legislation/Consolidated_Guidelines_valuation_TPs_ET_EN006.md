Insurance and reinsurance undertakings should ensure that the actuarial function takes into 
account  the conclusions of any relevant analysis performed in an external review, where data 
quality in the context of calculating technical provisions is reviewed.  
 
Guideline 5 - Consideration of the methodologies to be applied 
Insurance and reinsurance undertakings should ensure that the actuarial function takes into 
account the relation between the conclusions of the analysis of the data quality and the 
selection of the methodologies to be applied to value the technical provisions.  
Undertakings should ensure that the actuarial function analyses the extent to which data used 
is adequate to support the assumptions underlying the methodologies to be applied to value 
the technical provisions. If data does not adequately support the methodologies, then the 
undertakin g should select an alternative methodology.  
In the assessment of completeness of data, undertakings should ensure that the actuarial 
function considers whether the number of observations and granularity of available data is 
sufficient and adequate to meet the input requirement for the application of the methodology.  
Explanatory text  
14. It is important to highlight the link associated to the criterion of completeness (captured by 
the third paragraph). What is meant by this link is the fact that the data can be considered as complete assuming that the actuarial function intends to apply a particular method to 
calculate technical provisions but if the selected method requires more information (e.g. a 
longer data series than available) data would not satisfy this c riterion.  
15. The link between data quality and methodologies also applies on reverse: depending on the characteristics of the data available, the actuarial function may base its decision of applying a relevant method instead of another that could also lead t o an adequate reflection of the 
undertakingâ€™s risk profile, if the data available does not fulfil all the inputs required to implement the method. Also, depending on the result of the assessment of the data quality, the actuarial function shall gain insigh ts that will influence the selection of the most 
appropriate methodology to reproduce the underlying risks being measured.

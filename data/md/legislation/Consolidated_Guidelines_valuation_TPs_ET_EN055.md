referred in Article 58 (b) of Commission Delegated Regulation 2015/35, inter alia by using the 
modified duration of the insurance liabilities as a proportionality factor.  
When deciding on the application of a method based on the modified duration of the 
insurance liabilities, attention should be paid to the value of modified duration to avoid 
meaningless results for the Risk Margin. This method takes into account the maturity and the 
run- off pattern of the obligations net of reinsurance. Consequently, some considerations 
should be given regarding the manner in which t he best estimate of technical provisions net 
of reinsurance has been calculated. Further consideration should be given as to whether the 
assumptions regarding the risk profile of the undertaking can be considered unchanged over 
time. This includes:  
a) For ba sic SCR, to consider if the composition and the proportions of the risks and sub -risks 
do not change over the years;  
b) For counterparty default risk, to consider if the average credit standing of reinsurers and 
SPVs remains the same over the years;  
c) For oper ational risk and counterparty default risk, to consider if the modified duration is 
the same for obligations net and gross of reinsurance;  
d) To consider if the material market risk in relation to the net best estimate remains the 
same over the years;  
e) For a djustment, to consider if the loss absorbing capacity of the technical provisions in 
relation to the net best estimate remains the same over the years.  
An undertaking that intends to use this method should consider to what extend these 
assumptions are fulfilled. If some or all of these assumptions do not hold, the undertaking 
should carry out at least a qualitative assessment of how material the deviation from the 
assumptions is. If the impact of the deviation is not material compared to the risk margin as a 
whole, then the simplification can be used. Otherwise the undertaking should either adjust 
the formula appropriately or be encouraged to use a more sophisticated method.  
Method 4 
To approximate the risk margin by calculating it as a percentage of the bes t estimate.  
According to this method, the risk margin should be calculated as a percentage of the best 
estimate technical provisions net of reinsurance at valuation date. When deciding on the

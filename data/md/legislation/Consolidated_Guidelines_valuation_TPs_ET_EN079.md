206. The proposed simplification is considered proportionate if the cash in- flows and out -flows 
are equally distributed over the year.  
 
Section 5: Validation 
Guideline 83 – Proportionality of technical provisions validation  
Insurance and reinsurance undertakings should require the actuarial function to ensure that 
the validation process is proportionate, considering the significance of the impact, both in 
isolation and in combination, of assumptions, approximations and methodologies on the value 
of technical provisions.  
 
Guideline 84 – Selection of validation approaches and processes  
Insurance and reinsurance undertakings should require the actuarial function to consider 
which  validation approaches and processes are most appropriate depending on the 
characteristics of the liability and intended use for the approach or process.

207. A combination of validation techniques needs to be used to cross verify each other. E ach 
validation test will tell the actuarial function something specific and will have strengths, 
weaknesses and limitations. It is important that the user of the tests understands the test 
being used. Different tests will be selected to avoid systematic fa ilure in the validation 
approach and to ensure that material errors and identified.  
208. Expert judgment also needs to be validated and more details are included in the 
overarching paper on expert judgment.  
209. The following is a non- exhaustive list of possible approaches and processes:  
1. Examples of approaches which may support identifying emerging features, trends and 
distortions in the historical data:  
a) Percentiles and analysis of residuals to detect influential observations, outliers or clustering of claims;  
b) Ratios to detect the drivers or causes for certain patterns. For example, average cost per 
claim ratios;

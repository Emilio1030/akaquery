Guideline 70 – Methods to calculate provisions for incurred but not reported claims  
Where actuarial techniques (e.g.  chain ladder techniques) are used to estimate incurred but 
not reported provision (IBNR), insurance and reinsurance undertakings should pay a specific 
consideration to whether the assumptions behind the technique hold, or whether 
adjustments to developmen t patterns are required to appropriately reflect the likely future 
development.  
Explanatory text  
165. The consideration of the variance of the size of claims incurred in a year and the number of 
claims incurred in a given year is helpful as to determine whether there is a stable and 
reliable basis to ensure that the average claim size is representative.  
166. In non- life insurance, the actuarial methods used to determine best estimates and risk 
margins can be expected to range in complexity but will usually require granular company -
specific internal data, particularly for lines of business with pay -out periods of several years 
(so-called "long -tailed" lines of business).  
167. In cases where only few development years or occurrence years respectively are available, it is likely that the claims which are still open are the more complex ones with higher average 
of expected ultimate loss. Especially for reinsurance business, this simplification is not 
applicable, as necessary data are not available.  
168. A simplified method for the calculation of outstanding reported claims provision based on a ‘case -by-case approach’ may be appropriate in case of: a) high -severity -low-frequency 
claims, or b) new (re)insurance company or new line of business, although only temporarily until achieving sufficient information to apply standard methods.  
169. However, where the lack of information is expected to be permanent (e.g. the case of ‘tail’ risks with a very slow process of collecting claims information), the undertaking would be required to complement data available by making extra efforts to look for relevant external 
information to allow the understanding of the underlying risks and to use extensively 
adequate expert opinion and judgments.  
170. Another two possible methods to estimate the provision for incurred but not reported (IBNR) claims are:  
a) analysis of the number of claims expected and their average cost;  
b) ratios of IBNR to outstanding claims provisions.  
171. The situations in which each of these may be appropriate are set out below:

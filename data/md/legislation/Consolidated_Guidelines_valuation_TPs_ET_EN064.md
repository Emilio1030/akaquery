Calculation of claims provisions  
Guideline 69 â€“ Methods to calculate provisions for outstanding reported claims  
Insurance and reinsurance undertakings should not include the incurred but not reported 
provision (IBNR) and should not include unallocated loss adjustment expenses (ULAE) in the 
calculation of the outstanding reported claims provision, which represent the component of 
the claims pro vision where events giving rise to the claim have been notified to the insurer.  
Two possible methods to estimate the provision for outstanding reported claims are:  
- consideration of the number of claims reported and their average cost;  
- case -by-case estima tion.  
Explanatory text  
159. The situations in which each of these may be appropriate are set out below:  
a) Analysis of the number of claims reported and their average cost.  
This method may be appropriate for claims which have a short time lag to settlement 
and where the ultimate claim severities are reasonably stable. The stability of the ultimate claim severity could be demonstrated by an analysis of the variance of the size  
of claims at final settlement. In order to obtain a reliable estimate of the average cost, a sufficient number of origin and development years will need to be available.   
b) Case -by-case estimation.  
Where a case -by-case approach is applied, this should include an estimation of each 
individual provision for a single claim based upon up -to-date and credible information 
and realistic assumptions. Furthermore the following aspects should be considered:  
(a) These case estimates should take future inflation into account according to a 
reliable forecast of the payment pattern;  
(b) The future inflation rates should be market consistent and suitable for each line of business and company;  
(c) Individual valuations should be revised as information is updated;  
(d) Where back testing evidences a systematic bias in the valuation, this should be 
offset with an appropriate adjustment according to the experience gained with 
claims settlement in previous years and the expected future deviations.

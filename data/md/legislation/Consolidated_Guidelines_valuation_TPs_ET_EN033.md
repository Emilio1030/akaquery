Guideline 37 – Assumptions on policyholder behaviour  
Insurance and reinsurance undertakings should ensure that the assumptions relating to 
policyholder behaviour are founded in statistical and empirical evidence, where available. 
Undertakings should consider the extent to which policyholders exercise contractual options 
in a financially rational manner when deriving such assumptions. For this purpose, 
undertakings should give consideration to policyholders’ awareness of the value of policy 
options and to policyholders’ possible reactions to the changing financial position of the 
undertaking.  
Explanatory text  
92. Assumptions on policyholder behaviour are based on an analysis of past and likely fu ture 
policyholder behaviour, from a general market perspective and from the particular 
perspective of the undertaking. Assumptions are based on the experience of the 
undertaking in relation to the exercise of contractual options, where appropriate, but ref lect 
the likely trends in experience as a result of any change in the circumstances of the company and its customers, changing market conditions and other external factors.  
93. In case of significantly rising interest rates in the capital market, impacts on t he persistence 
of the business in force should be analysed. It should be examined whether the impact varies by product type or target group (e.g. contracts where the policyholder does not bear the investment risk, contracts with profitparticipation clauses).  
94. The impact of adverse developments in financial markets on the exercising of lump -sum 
options of deferred pension policies should also be considered.

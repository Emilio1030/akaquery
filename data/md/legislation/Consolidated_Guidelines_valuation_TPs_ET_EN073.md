- expenses directly related to future premiums should be excluded since the underlying 
assumption is that no future premiums will be received (e.g. some acquisition 
expenses);  
- fixed costs should remain unchanged (e.g. no hypothesis on lower costs – such as 
salaries - should be used because no future premiums will be received);  
- variable expenses should be influenced only indirectly because without future premiums, the invested reserve will not increase as planned (e.g. for investment 
management expenses, using the same management fee percentage as in the official 
technical provisions without risk margin but applied to lower amounts).  
185. EPIFP calculation is directly connected to best estimate valuation. It therefore requires sound actuarial knowledge and deep understanding of best estimate modelling. For this reason, the staff in charge of best estimate valuation is expected to have a role on EPIFP 
calculation (e.g. validation by the actuarial function).  
186. For example, EPIFP calculation can be simulated usin g existing options for the contract, 
mainly the paid- up option. However, in this case insurance and reinsurance undertakings 
should adjust the calculation to comply with Guideline 77, in particular not considering any 
material penalty in the calculation. C ontracts without paid -up option can also follow the 
approach described in Guideline 77, although this will probably require further adjustments to the calculation system.  
187. Alternatively, insurance and reinsurance undertakings can use the approach described  in 
Guideline 77a.  
Guideline 77A – Alternative approach to calculate to calculate EPIFP  
Insurance and reinsurance undertakings may identify EPIFP as the part of present value of 
future profits related to future premiums in case the outcome does not materia lly deviate from 
the value that would have resulted from the valuation described in Guideline 77. This approach 
may be implemented using a formula design .

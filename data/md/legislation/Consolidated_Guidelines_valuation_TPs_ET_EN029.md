Projection of Expenses  
Guideline 32 – Consistency of expenses with other cash- flows  
Insurance and reinsurance undertakings should allocate expenses in the cashflow projection 
so that the timing of expense cash -flows is consistent with the  timing of other cash in -flows 
and cash out -flows required to settle the insurance and reinsurance obligations.

75. For example  premium billing expenses should be aligned with the time when the premium 
payment is due or expenses connected with the conversion should be aligned in time with 
the conversion of a policy. Similarly expenses connected with the lapse of a policy or with claims should be aligned in time with the relevant lapse or claim event.  
 
Guideline 33 – Changes in expenses  
Insurance and reinsurance undertakings should ensure that assumptions with respect to the 
evolution of expenses over time, including future expense s arising from commitments made 
on or prior to the valuation date, are appropriate and consider the nature of the expenses 
involved. Insurance and reinsurance u ndertakings should make an allowance for inflation that 
is consistent with the economic assumpti ons made and with dependency of expenses on other 
cash flows of the contract .

76. Future expense cash flows are usually assumed to vary with assumed rates of general level of expense inflation in a reasonable manner.  
77. Relevant market data should be used to determine expense assumptions that include an allowance for future cost increases. When determining correlation between inflation rates 
and interest rates, use of expert judgement is often needed. An undertaking should ensure 
that the allowanc e for inflation is consistent with the economic assumptions made, which 
could be achieved if the probabilities for each inflation scenario are consistent with 
probabilities implied by market interest rates.  
78. Furthermore, expense inflation should be consiste nt with the inflation expectations in the 
country in concern and the types of expenses being considered. For example, when

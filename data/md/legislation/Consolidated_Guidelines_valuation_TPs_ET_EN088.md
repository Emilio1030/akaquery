does not vary considerably throughout the development yea rs, the risk charge can be approximated 
by applying reinsurers’ share of best estimates to the level of risk charge that is observed in year 0.  
 
According to the standard formula counterparty default risk for reinsurance ceded is assessed for 
the whole por tfolio instead of separate segments. If the risk of default in a segment is deemed to 
be similar to the total default risk or if the default risk in a segment is of negligible importance then 
the risk charge can be arrived at by applying reinsurers’ share of best estimates to the level of the 
total capital charge for reinsurers’ default risk in year 0.  
 With respect to level (2) of the hierarchy:  
 
By using a representative example of a proportional method the reference undertaking’s SCR for 
the year t cou ld be fixed in the following manner:  
 
𝑆𝑆𝐶𝐶𝑆𝑆𝑅𝑅𝑅𝑅(𝑡𝑡)=𝑆𝑆𝐶𝐶𝑆𝑆𝑅𝑅𝑅𝑅(0)∙𝐼𝐼𝑈𝑈𝑁𝑁𝑛𝑛𝑡𝑡(𝑡𝑡)
𝐼𝐼𝑈𝑈𝑁𝑁𝑛𝑛𝑡𝑡(0)         𝑡𝑡=1,2,3,… 
 
where  
 𝑆𝑆𝐶𝐶𝑆𝑆
𝑅𝑅𝑅𝑅(𝑡𝑡) = SCR as calculated at time t≥0 for the reference undertaking’s portfolio of (re)insurance 
obligations;  
 𝐼𝐼𝑈𝑈
𝑁𝑁𝑛𝑛𝑡𝑡(𝑡𝑡) = best estimate technical provisions net of reinsurance as assessed at time t≥0 for the 
undertaking’s portfolio of (re)insurance obligati ons.  
 
The simplification described above can be applied also at a more granular level, i.e. for individual 
modules and/or submodules. However, it is noted that the number of calculations to be carried out will in general be proportional with the number of  modules and/or submodules for which this 
simplification is applied. Moreover, it needs to be considered whether a more granular calculation as indicated above will lead to a more accurate estimate of the future SCRs to be used in the 
calculation of the risk margin.   With respect to level (3) of the hierarchy:  
 With respect to life insurance the duration approach implies that the risk margin 𝐶𝐶𝐶𝐶𝐶𝐶𝐶𝐶  could be 
calculated according to the following formula:  
 
𝐶𝐶𝐶𝐶𝐶𝐶𝐶𝐶 =𝐶𝐶𝐶𝐶𝐶𝐶∙𝐷𝐷𝐷𝐷𝑃𝑃
𝑚𝑚𝑙𝑙𝑟𝑟(0)∙𝑆𝑆𝐶𝐶𝑆𝑆𝑅𝑅𝑅𝑅(0)/ (1+𝑃𝑃) 
 where:  
 𝑆𝑆𝐶𝐶𝑆𝑆
𝑅𝑅𝑅𝑅(0) = the SCR as calculated at time t=0 for the reference undertaking’s portfolio of 
(re)insurance obligations;  
 𝐷𝐷𝐷𝐷𝑃𝑃
𝑚𝑚𝑙𝑙𝑟𝑟(0) = the modified duration of reference undertaking’s (re)insurance obligations net of 
reinsurance at t=0; and

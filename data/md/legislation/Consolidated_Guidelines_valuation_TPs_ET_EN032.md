Guideline 36 – Appropriateness of assumptions  
Insurance and reinsurance undertakings should ensure that the assumptions used in the 
valuation of contractual options and financial guarantees are consistent with current market 
data, current market practice, policyholder and management behaviour specific to the 
characteristics of the business and the undertaking. Undertakings should also consider the 
impact of adverse market conditions and trends and establish a regular process for updating 
and ensuring that those assumptions are still r ealistic taking into account all additional 
information since the last calculation of technical provisions.  
Explanatory text  
87. Contractual options are present where there is the right to change the benefits, to be taken 
at the choice of its holder (generally  the policyholder), on terms that are established in 
advance.  
88. A financial guarantee is present when there is the possibility to pass losses to the 
undertaking or to receive additional benefits8 as a result of the evolution of financial 
variables; solely o r in conjunction with non -financial variables (e.g. investment return of the 
underlying asset portfolio, performance of indices, etc.).  
89. In order to trigger an option, a deliberate decision of its holder is necessary. In the case of 
guarantees, the trigger  is generally automatic (the mechanism would be set in the policy’s 
terms and conditions) and thus not dependent on a deliberate decision of the policyholder.  
90. Some non -exhaustive examples of contractual options which may be predetermined in a 
contract and  do not require again the consent of the parties to renew or modify the contract 
include the following:  
a) Surrender value option, where the policyholder has the right to fully or partially surrender the policy and receive a pre -defined lump sum amount; 8 This has to be 
interpreted as also including the potential for reduction of the level of premiums that would be charged in the future.  
b) Paid -up policy option, where the policyholder has the right to stop paying premiums 
and change the policy to a paid- up sta tus;  
c) Annuity conversion option, where the policyholder has the right to convert a lump survival benefit into an annuity at a pre -defined minimum rate of conversion;  
d) Policy conversion option, where the policyholder has the right to convert from one 
policy to another at pre -specific terms and conditions;

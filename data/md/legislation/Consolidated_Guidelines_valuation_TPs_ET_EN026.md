Expense allocation  
Guideline 29 – Granularity of allocation of expenses  
Insurance and reinsurance undertak ings should allocate the expenses into homogeneous risk 
groups, as a minimum by line of business, according to the segmentation of their obligations 
used in the calculation of technical provisions.  
Explanatory text  
62. Expenses that are pertinent to the valuation of technical provisions would usually include 
both allocated and overhead expenses. Allocated expenses are those expenses which could 
be directly assignable to the source of expense that will be incurred in servicing insurance and reinsurance obligatio ns. Overhead expenses comprise all other expenses which the 
undertaking incurs in servicing insurance and reinsurance obligations.  
63. The first paragraph of Article 31 of the Implementing Measures explicitly list expenses which relate to recognised insurance  and reinsurance obligations.  
64. Administrative expenses are expenses which are connected with policy administration including expenses in respect of reinsurance contracts and special purpose vehicles. Some administrative expenses relate directly to the insurance contract or the contract activity 
(e.g. maintenance cost) such as the cost of premium billing, the cost of sending regular 
information to policyholders and the cost of handling policy changes (e.g. conversions and reinstatements). Other administrative expenses relate directly to insurance contracts or contract activities but are a result of activities that cover more than one policy such as 
salaries of staff responsible for policy administration.  
65. Investment management expenses are usually not allocat ed on a policy by policy basis but 
at the level of a portfolio of insurance contracts. Investment management expenses could 
include expenses of recordkeeping of the investments’ portfolio, salaries of staff responsible for investments, remunerations of ext ernal advisers, expenses connected with an 
investment trading activity (i.e. buying and selling of the portfolio securities) and in some cases also remuneration for custodial services.  
66. Claims management expenses are expenses that will be incurred in processing and resolving claims, including legal and adjuster’s fees and internal costs of processing claims payments.

118. Due to the uncertainty of future events, any modelling of future cash flows (implicitly or 
explicitly contained in the valuation methodology) will necessarily be imperfect, leading to 
a certain degree of inaccurac y and imprecision in the measurement (or model error). Where 
simplified approaches are used to value technical provisions, this could potentially introduce additional uncertainty because they are generally based on some kind of 
simplifying assumptions rega rding the risk which are modelled (e.g. independency of some 
risks, proportionality between different risk -factors, neglecting future development, etc.).  
119. As prescribed in Recital (16) of the of the Implementing Measures, undertakings are not 
required to s pecify the precise amount of the error, which would be in practice not easy to 
achieve. Hence, the actuarial function is not required to re -calculate the value of its 
technical provisions using a more complex method in order to demonstrate that the differe nce between the result of the chosen method and the result of a more complex 
method is immaterial. However, in some circumstances it could be appropriate to carry out 
such a calculation.  
120. Instead, it is sufficient to demonstrate that there is reasonable as surance that the error 
implied by the application of the chosen method (and hence the difference between those 
two amounts) is immaterial.  
121. For example, if the method is based on a simplifying assumption to ignore one or more risk 
drivers, an assessment of their impact on the best estimate (e.g. in percentage terms) could 
be sufficient to justify the non -materiality of the error introduced by the simplified 
assumption.  
122. An assessment of the model error may be carried out, by:  
a) Sensitivity analysis in the fr amework of the applied model: this means to vary the 
parameters and/or data thereby observing the range where a best estimate might be 
located;  
b) Comparison with the results of other methods: applying different methods gives 
insight in potential model error s. These methods would not necessarily need to be 
more complex;  
c) Descriptive statistics: in some cases the applied model allows the derivation of descriptive statistics on the estimation error contained in the estimation. Such information may assist in qua ntitatively describing the sources of uncertainty;  
d) Back -testing: comparing the results of the estimation against experience may help to 
identify systemic deviations which are due to deficiencies in the modelling;  
e) Stress test scenario as benchmark.

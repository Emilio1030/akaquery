a) Analysis of the number of claims expected and their average cost . 
This method may be appropriate for short tail business where there is no material 
observed change in claims frequ ency or where delay tables are available to determine 
the number of claims expected in future periods. An example of a practical implementation of such a method is given in the Technical Annex.  
b) Ratios of IBNR to outstanding claims provisions.  
This method  will be appropriate where the ratio of IBNR to outstanding claims 
provision is expected to be stable for a given point in the claims development, the strength of case estimation is stable over time and reliable data are available to assess what a suitable  ratio may be. This method may be used where robust data are not 
available to use other estimation methods.

claims settlement expenses based on an estimate as a percentage of the claims provision, as 
outlined in Technical Annex II, this should only be considered when expenses can reasonably 
be assumed to be proportionate to provisions as a whole, where this proportion is stable in 
time and where the expenses distribute uniformly over the lifetime of the claims portfolio as 
a whole.

Calculation of premium provisions  
Guideline 72 – Cover  
Insurance and reinsurance undertakings should ensure that premium provisions at the 
valuation date include the valuation of all recognised obligations within the boundary of 
insurance or reinsurance contracts, for all exposure to future claims events, wher e:

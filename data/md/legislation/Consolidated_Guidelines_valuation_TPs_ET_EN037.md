Guideline 40B – Consideration of new business in setting future management actions  
Insurance and reinsurance undertakings should consider the effect of new business in setting 
future management actions and duly consider the consequences on other related 
assumptions. In particular, the fact that the set of cash -flows to be projected through the 
application of Article 18 of the Delegated R egulation on contract boundaries is limited should  
not lead insurance and reinsurance undertakings to consider that assumptions only rely on 
this projected set of cash -flows without any influence of new business. This is particularly the 
case for assumptions on the allocation of risky assets, management of the duration gap or 
application of profit sharing mechanisms .

101. Future business can be split into three categories: Future business within contract 
boundaries (i.e. included in best estimate), future business related to current contracts but falling beyond contract boundaries (e.g. premiums to be received aft er the contract 
boundary and therefore no included in best estimate) and future business related to new contracts. Even if only the first category is included in best estimate, all of the categories may need to be considered when setting best estimate assu mptions and, in particular, 
assumptions linked to future management actions.  
102. This is particularly relevant for with profit contracts when profit sharing mechanisms in the 
future will apply to both the existing and the new business combined. In those cases , the 
interdependency of the new business and the existing business on the value of options and 
guarantees should be duly taken into account for valuing best estimates. Realistic assumptions based on the historical practices of the insurance or reinsurance  undertakings 
should apply, independently of the fact that the application of principles on contract boundaries limit the set of cash flow to be projected.  
103. For example, If the assumption of writing new business (linked to existing contracts or linked to new contracts) in the future leads to different investment profits than the assumption of 
having no business after the contract boundary, undertakings should  project investment 
profits based on the assumption of writing new business. This does not mean that  
undertakings need to estimate and project future profits linked to new business.  
104. Similarly, insurance and reinsurance undertakings should consider a balanced approach when setting up assumptions on the projection of future investments. Indeed, as those 
undertakings usually continue writing new business, their past experience is based on 
relatively stable allocation on risky assets and duration of bond portfolio – with potential 
adjustment on duration gap. However as the set of cash flow to be projected is limited,

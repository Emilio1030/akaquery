insurance undertakings do not have historical evidence of assumptions for such a “run -off” 
projection. Thus, insurance and reinsurance undertakings should adopt a balanced 
approach to define assumptions so that those are realistic, based on empirical evidences without exacerbating the fact that the cash flows are limited.  
105. For instance, a large reduction of risky assets to reinvest in cash or cash equivalent will usually not be considered as realistic as it reduces the volatility of the assets – and the 
values of options and guarantees - across the projection without any empirical justification. 
A large reduction of the duration of assets in the first years of projection is also unrealistic if contracts are projected over decades.  
 
Future discretionary benefits  
Guideline 4 1 – Allowance for future discretionary benefits   
Insurance and reinsurance undertakings should take into account future discretionary benefits 
which are expected to be made, whether or not such payments are contractually guaranteed.  
Undertakings should ensure that the assessment of the value of future discretionary benefits 
considers all relevant legal and contractual restrictions, existing profit participation 
arrangements as well as any plans for distribution of profits.

106. Payments that relate to surplus funds which possess the characteristics of Tier 1 basic own funds need not to be taken into account. Surplus funds are accumulated profits which have not been made available for distribution to policyholders and benef iciaries (cf. Article 91 of 
Solvency II). Payments that relate to future profits attributable to shareholders in respect 
of profit participation arrangements do not form part of technical provisions.  
107. When calculating technical provisions, the value of fut ure discretionary benefits needs to 
be separately identifiable, as this amount is used as an input for the calculation of the 
minimum capital requirement and for the loss -absorbing capacity of technical provisions in 
the standard formula to capture the sol vency capital requirement.  
108. Some examples of assumptions for distributing discretionary benefits are given below. The 
undertaking should consider whether they are relevant and material for the valuation of 
future discretionary benefits and thus are taken into account, applying the principle of proportionality.

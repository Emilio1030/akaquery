Guideline 42 – Assumptions on future discretionary benefits  
Insurance and reinsurance undertakings should ensure that assumptions regarding the 
distribution of future discretionary benefits are derived in an objective, realistic and verifiable 
manner encompassing the principles and practices adopted by the undertaking to provide 
insurance contracts with profit participation. Where the distribution of future discretionary 
benefits is related to the financial position of the undertaking, the assumptions should reflect 
the interaction between the assets and liabilities of the undertaking.  
 
Guideline 4 3 – Assumptions in respect of modelling distribution of future discretionary 
benefits  
Insurance and reinsurance undertakings should consider a comprehensive analysis of past 
experience, practice and distribution mechanism when assessing the proportionality  of a 
simplified method used for determining the future discretionary benefits.

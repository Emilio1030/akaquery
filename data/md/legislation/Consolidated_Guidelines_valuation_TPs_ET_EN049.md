137. Stochastic modelling of options and guarantees intends to capture their time value, which 
is not captured following deterministic valuation. The time value of options and guarantees 
can be captured in any case using simulation methods, but in some simple cases it can also be measured accurately with closed -formula approaches. In addition, considering the high 
costs of stochastic valuation and following the proportionality principle, for non -material 
options and guarantees simplified approaches may be used when available.  
138. Profit sharing usually works under asymmetric basis: profits are shared with the policyholders while losses are completely assumed by the undertaking. Under such 
circumstances, stochastic valuation is particularly relevant, since a set of scenarios might lead to a significantly higher best estimate than a single average scenario under a  
deterministic approach.  
139. The combined effect of financial guarantees and surrender options might also be particularly relevant. A guaranteed rate might increase the value of surrender option: the policyholder would keep its policy in unprofitable low inter est rates environment and 
surrender it in high interest rates environment. Therefore, the average present value of the liabilities may significantly increase compared to a deterministic calculation.  
 
Guideline 54 â€“ Methodologies for the valuation of contractual options and financial 
guarantees  
Insurance and reinsurance undertakings should apply the proportionality assessment referred 
to in Article 56 of Commission Delegated Regulation 2015/35 when considering the use of a 
closed formula approach or a stochastic approach for the valuation of contractual options and 
financial guarantees included in the insurance contracts.  
Whenever neither method is possible, undertakings may use as a last resort an approach 
consisting in the following steps:  
a) Analysis of the characteristics of the option or guarantee and of how it would affect the 
cash -flows;  
b) Analysis of the amount the option or guarantee is expected to be currently in -the-money 
or out -of-the-money;  
c) Determination of the cost of the option or guarantees is expected to vary with time;

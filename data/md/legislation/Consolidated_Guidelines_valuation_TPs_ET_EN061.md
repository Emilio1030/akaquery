157. Considering the insurance contract, the following examples show different cases and the 
treatment to be applied:  
Example  Have requirements in Article 77(4), 
second paragraph, of the Level 1 
text been met?  Technical provisions shall be 
calculated:  
The insurance 
undertaking shall pay the market value of an equity portfolio or shall deliver an equity portfolio (matching an index or not) at the 
payment date.  Yes, but only under one condition: a 
reliable market value for every asset within the portfolio is observable. However there are, for example, fixed expense cash -flows associated 
with this contract which shall be excluded because they depend on 
the development of magnitudes 
internal to the undertaking.  • As a whole (if the condition 
is met). This also applies when the contract pays the market 
value of the units at the 
earlier of maturity, death or surrender.  
• Best Estimate + Risk Margin 
(if not and for the expense cash -flows)  
Term -assurance 
contracts and withprofits contracts.  No: In these cases the expected 
value, the volatility and other features of the future cash -flows 
associated with insurance obligations depend on the biometric development as well as on the 
behaviour of the policyholder.  Best Estimate + Risk Margin  
Pure Unit -linked 
contract (without any 
additional guarantees)  Yes: regarding to the number of units 
guaranteed, and  
No:  expense cash -flows associated 
with the fact that the contract will be managed till it ends. • For the calculation of the 
technical provisions, these two aspects of the contract 
must be unbundled:  
• As a whole; Best Estimate + 
Risk Margin (only for the expenses)

3 The annual expense loading is generally fixed in percentage of the value of technical provisions at a certain date. The amount 
guaranteed to the policyholder is the market value of a number of units reduced by the expense loading. The loading is generally  at 
such a level that it covers more than the expenses incurred, thus including future profits. The best estimate of such an obli gation 
would be negative. However, in a stress situation, the market value of the unit can fall so low that the expense loading  is no longer 
sufficient to cover the expenses incurred. Therefore, a capital requirement and a risk margin need to be calculated.

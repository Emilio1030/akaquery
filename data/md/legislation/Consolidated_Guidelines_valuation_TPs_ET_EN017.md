arise from combining dissimilar business. Therefore, business is usually managed in more 
granular homogeneous risk groups than the proposed minimum segmentation where it 
allows for a more accurate valuation of technical provisions.  
36. Undertakings in different Member States and even undertakings in the same Member State offer insurance products covering different sets of risks. Therefore it is appropriate for each undertaking to define the homogeneous risk group and the l evel of granularity most 
appropriate for their business and in the manner needed to derive appropriate assumptions for the calculation of the best estimate.  
37. For example, the grouping has to consider whether policies containing financial guarantees which a re "significantly in the money" (i.e. where the intrinsic value is positive) need to be 
separated from policies which contain financial guarantees that are "significantly out of the 
money".  
 
Guideline 23 – Segmentation in respect of premium provisions and claims provisions  
Insurance and reinsurance undertakings should consider both the nature of the underlying 
risks being evaluated together and the quality of data in selecting the homogeneous risk 
groups for the calculations of the premium pr ovisions and claims provisions.  
Explanatory text  
38. Premium provisions need to be valued based on the most appropriate subsets of data 
available. Data used does not necessarily have to be segmented into the same homogeneous risk groups as that used in calcula ting the claims provisions. For example, if 
data is sparse for a particular risk group, it may be combined with another, similar, risk group 
in order to obtain a more meaningful data set for valuation purposes.

Guideline 24 – Consis tency of assumptions  
Insurance and reinsurance undertakings should ensure that assumptions used in the 
determination of technical provisions, own funds and solvency capital requirement are 
consistent.

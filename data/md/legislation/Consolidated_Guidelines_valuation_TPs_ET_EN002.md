Section 0 - Proportionality  
Guideline 0 – Proportionality  
Insurance and reinsurance undertakings should apply the Guidelines on valuation of technical 
provisions in a manner that is proportionate to the nature, scale and complexity of the risks 
inherent  in their business. This shoul d not result in a material deviation of the value of the 
technical from the current amount that insurance and reinsurance undertakings would have 
to pay if they were to transfer their insurance and reinsurance obligations immediately to 
another insurance o r reinsurance undertaking  
Explanatory text  
1. All new guidelines on expert judgement are identical to the guidelines on expert judgement 
included in the Guidelines on the use of internal models1 except for Guideline 24a – 
Materiality in assumptions setting, which has been slightly adapted to best estimate valuation. 
2. Moreover, insurance and reinsurance undertakings usually have more data for best estimate valuation than for solvency capital requir ement valuation. Thus, even if the 
principles that are applicable for expert judgment in best estimate valuation and within 
internal models are similar, their implementation might slightly differ. For instance, it is 
expected that insurance and reinsurance  undertakings mainly focus on the identification of 
material assumptions where expert judgment is needed and implement a proportionate 
framework in terms of documentation, governance or validation process for those 
assumptions only. In particular, the gove rnance and validation process might involve 
internal committees, senior executive committees or the administrative management and supervisory body depending on the predefined framework and the sensitivity of the best 
estimate calculation to some material assumptions relying on expert judgment.  
3. It is not possible to define specific criteria for assessing materiality of any expert judgment 
use case. However, this could usually be based on sensitivity tests with a percentage of variation of technical provisions or future profits. It could either be considered at portfolio level or for the whole calculation, depending on the nature of the assumption. One criteria 
might also be defined based on the users (e.g. would a significant change in an assumption 
set by ex pert judgment influence decisions taken by the management body - change in the 
program of reinsurance, change in the activities/products sold, etc.).

160. In assessing the degree of model error introduced by a case -by-case approach, undertakings 
should assess the reliability of the information to support these assumptions at the relevant 
cohort level.  
161. Moreover, the undertaking should provide w ritten documentation on at least:  
a) The procedures applicable to assess the initial valuation of a claim when hardly anything is known about its features. Valuation must be based on the experience on 
the average cost of claims with similar features;  
b) The method to include inflation, discounting and direct expenses;  
c) The frequency of the valuations review which must be at least quarterly;  
d) The procedure to take into account the changes in both entity specific, legal, social, or economic environmental factors;  
e) The requirements in order to consider the claim to be settled.  
162. A case -by-case approach may be considered suitable where there are relatively low 
numbers of claims to estimate and where there is significant variability in claim sizes.  
163. Obviously this metho d only applies where the incurred and reported claims provision has 
been valued without considering IBNR, for example it has been assessed using some of the 
aforementioned simplifications.  
Concepts related to claims provisions, i.e. all claims occurring on  or before the valuation date  
• Claims paid : Claims payments already made.  
• Reported But Not Settled (RBNS) : Claims in respect of claim events that have 
happened and reported to the insurer, but have not yet been settled. These could 
represent estimates from  claims handlers, mechanical estimates, factor based 
approaches etc. The key is consistency in strength over time, it does not include IBNR  
• Pure IBNER : ‘Incurred but not enough reported’, claim events have happened and 
reported to the insurer but the amount set up for these may need to be adjusted. Can 
be positive or negative.  
• Pure IBNR : ‘Incurred but not reported’, claim events have happened but the i nsurer 
has not yet been informed of any claims.  
• IBNR:  A term which is commonly used to describe the sum of the IBNER and IBNR 
components across a portfolio of claims; i.e. this number represents the difference 
between the total ultimate and incurred amoun t reported to the insurer for claims 
which have already occurred.

considering the overall expense inflation of a homogeneous risk group, different levels of 
inflation might be expected regarding office space rents, salaries of different types of staff, 
IT systems, medical expenses, etc.  
79. In some cases, explicit inflation expenses may not be needed. For example, investment management expenses may be defined as a percentage of the value of the underlying  
investment funds and the product may not require explicit assumptions on inflation as 
inflation does not affect the expense assumptions.  
80. When determining the inflation rate, proportionality principle can be used taking into 
account the materiality of the expense inflation assumption and prudency requirement in 
accordance with Article 56(4) of the Delegated Regulation.  
 
Guideline 34 â€“ Simplifications in respect of expenses   
When assessing the nature, scale and complexity of risks underlying the expenses wh ich are 
taken into account in the calculation of the technical provisions, insurance and reinsurance 
undertakings should take into account, inter alia, the uncertainty of future expense cash -flows, 
and any event that can change the amount, frequency and se verity of expense cash -flows.  
Undertakings should also take into account the type of expenses and the degree of correlation 
between different types of expenses.  
When using a simplification for the projection of expenses based on a model which uses 
informat ion on current and past expense loadings to project future expense loadings including 
inflation, undertakings should analyse current and historical expenses, giving consideration to, 
inter alia, where expenses occur and the factors that influence the expen ses. Undertakings 
should include in the proportionality assessment an analysis of how the expenses are related 
to the size and nature of insurance portfolios. Undertakings should not apply the simplification 
where expenses have substantially changed or are  expected not to cover all but only part of 
the expenses required to service insurance and reinsurance obligations.  
Explanatory text  
81. The approach to value the expense liability relies on the existence of a model that projects the expenses into the future c onsistently with other cash -flows. This may require rather 
sophisticated modelling that might not be justified for all undertakings.

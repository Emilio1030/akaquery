Guidel ine 49 – Consequences of material error identified in the proportionality assessment  
Where it is unavoidable for the insurance and reinsurance undertaking to use a method which 
leads to material level of error, the undertaking should document this and consider the 
implications with regard to the reliability of the calculation of technical provisions and its 
overall solvency position. In particular the undertaking should assess whether the material 
level of error is adequately addressed in the determination of the Solvency Capital 
Requirement and hence in the setting of the risk margin in technical provisions.

123. In some circumstances, it may be unavoidable for the undertaking to apply a valuation 
method which leads to an increased level of estimation uncertainty in the valuation. This 
could e.g. be the case where there is only insufficient pertinent past experienc e data 
available to derive or validate assumptions or in case of portfolios with high -severity -low-
frequency claims  
 
Methods applied for calculations of technical provisions during the year  
Guideline 50 – Simplified calculation of technical provisions duri ng the year  
Insurance and reinsurance undertakings may use simplifications, for example the 
simplification outlined in Technical Annex VI, subject to the proportionality assessment, in the 
quarterly calculations of technical provisions.  
Explanatory text  
124. According to Article 129(4) of Solvency II, the MCR needs to be calculated quarterly. This 
necessitates a quarterly calculation of technical provisions to derive the input values for the 
calculation of the MCR and to derive the own funds.  
125. The calculation of technical provisions between the annual reporting dates may give rise to 
additional practicability issues. For example, the data basis of the undertaking may not be adequate for this task. In non- life insurance, undertakings often colle ct data on an annual 
basis, i.e. ordered per accident year, underwriting year, run- off year etc.  
126. Another example are calculations which are so resource intensive that – compared to a 
partial recalculation – their full repetition during the year may not be  in proportion with the

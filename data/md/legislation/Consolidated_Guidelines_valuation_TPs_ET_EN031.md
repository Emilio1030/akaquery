82. Under a stochastic simulation approach the expenses to be incurred should be explicitly 
included in the simulation and the  future expense inflation needs to be consistent with what 
is assumed in the interest rate assumptions and other relevant factors influencing the 
expenses. In many cases, both the future expenses and the expense loadings may be sensitive to changes in infl ation. However, one cannot assume these to be equal to each 
other unless there is proper evidence of such matching. The reference for expense inflation needs to be based on the published prediction of an appropriate inflation -index.  
83. For the attribution of  overhead expenses, a possible simplification is the method described 
in Technical Annex II.  
 
Treatment of financial guarantees and contractual options  
Guideline 35 – Charges for embedded options  
Insurance and reinsurance undertakings should explicitly take into account amounts charged 
to policy holders relating to embedded options.  
Explanatory text  
84. Charges from embedded options should be taken into account in the best estimate valuation of technical provisions and should be calculated separately from expense loadings. For example a surrender charge could possibly be seen as a charge to offset the 
uncollected charges on average, but could also be seen as a way to force the policyholder 
to continue t he contract and hence it would not directly be related to the cost of embedded 
options.  
85. Some charging structures for embedded options are disclosed in the valuation basis for a product, whereas some charging structures are disclosed in an undertaking’s pr inciples and 
practices to run the business.  
86. Possible simplifications for other charges are to assume that:  
- other charges are a constant share of extra benefits; or  
- a constant charge (in relative terms) from the policy fund.

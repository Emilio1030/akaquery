Guideline 74 – Uncertainty of policyholder behaviour  
Insurance and reinsurance undertakings should ensure that the valuation of premium 
provisions includes an allowance for the possibility that policyholders will exercise options to 
extend or renew a co ntract or to cancel or lapse a contract prior to the end of the cover term 
provided.  
Explanatory text  
174. Factors affecting policyholder behaviour include but are not limited to:  
- Quality of sales advice;  
- Quality of claims handling service;  
- Scale and nature of policyholder contract from inception.  
175. Policyholders’ option to lapse non -life insurance may be dependent on the change of 
policyholders’ status such as the ability to further pay the premium; however, it may also 
depend on an adjustmen t to their cover such as a change in vehicle or moving house. 
Similarly commercial covers may no longer fit the needs of the business due to 
restructuring, growth, redundancies or closure.  
176. It is important to consider whether the presence of policyholder o ptions could materially 
change the economic nature of the risk covered under the terms of the contract if exercised, 
i.e. where they have an option to exercise an extension or lapse anti -selection issues may 
arise. In such circumstances the cash -flow projection has to take into account of the 
proportion of policyholders that are expected to take up the options and the expected deterioration in net future cash -flows arising from anti -selection by policyholders.  
 
Guideline 75 – Negative premium provision  
Insurance and reinsurance undertakings should ensure that, where the present value of future 
cash in -flows exceeds the present value of future cash outflows the premium provision, 
excluding risk margin, is negative.

177. Where premium provisions ar e negative, it is also possible that the technical provisions may 
be negative, particularly for classes of business with short settlement patterns. Where this is the case a negative value has to be recorded in the balance sheet for Solvency II.

4. Finally, the validation process regarding expert judgment might usually not be independent 
from the genera l validation process that insurance and reinsurance undertakings 
implement to validate the calculation of the technical provisions in order to maintain and 
promote homogeneity and convergence. Thus, use of expert judgments should be fully integrated in the  different steps of validation (e.g. internal committees, “clearance” 
committees or management committees) depending on the nature, complexity and materiality of the cases where expert judgment has been applied.  
 
Section 1: Data quality  
Clarification of t he concepts of completeness and appropriateness of data  
Guideline 1 – Completeness of data  
Insurance and reinsurance undertakings should ensure that data used in the calculation of 
technical provisions cover a sufficiently large period of observations that  characterise the 
reality being measured.  
To perform the calculation of premium provisions for non -life obligations, undertakings should 
ensure that sufficient historical information is available on the total cost of claims and their 
actual trends at a suf ficiently granular level.  
To perform the calculation of provisions for claims outstanding, undertakings should ensure 
that sufficient data are available to allow for the identification of relevant patterns on the 
claims development, and with sufficient granularity, in order to permit analysis of such 
patterns within homogeneous risk groups.

5. A sufficiently large period of observations is necessary to enable the identification of 
relevant trends or cycles in the data.  
6. To project the cash -flows arising from life provisions, sufficient data needs to be available 
to allow for the projection of, namely: - the behaviour of the biometric factors, such as 
mortality and morbidity rates; - the probabilities associated to the policyholders’ exercise 
of contractual options (lapses and surrenders); - all types of expenses incurred in servicing 
insurance and reinsurance obligations.  
7. For example, where only one run -off triangle of paid claims, containing 5 years of historical 
information is available to be  used as input in the calculation of claims provision for Motor

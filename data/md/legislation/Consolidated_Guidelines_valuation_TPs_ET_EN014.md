Section 2: Segmentation and unbundling  
Guideline 17 – Segmentation of insurance or reinsurance obligations stemming from health 
and other non- life insurance contracts  
Insurance and reinsurance undertakings should ensure that insurance or reinsurance 
obligations stemming from health and other non -life insurance contracts should be segme nted 
to life lines of business where such obligations are exposed to biometrical risks (i.e. mortality, 
longevity or disability or morbidity) and where the common techniques that are used to assess 
such obligations explicitly take into consideration the be haviour of the variables underlying 
these risks.  
Where health insurance or reinsurance obligations are calculated according to the conditions 
set out in Article 206 of Solvency II, insurance and reinsurance undertakings should ensure 
that these obligations  are considered to be pursued on a similar technical basis to that of life 
insurance and therefore assigned to life lines of business.  
 
Guideline 18 – Change in the segmentation of non- life insurance or reinsurance obligations  
Insurance and reinsurance undertakings should ensure that insurance or reinsurance 
obligations that were originally segmented into non -life lines of business and, as a result of the 
occurrence of an insured event turn into life insurance or reinsurance obligations, should be 
assessed using life techniques that explicitly take into consideration the behaviour of the 
variables underlying biometrical risks and assigned to the relevant life lines of business as soon 
as there is sufficient information to assess those obligations using life techniques.  
 
Guideline 19 – Determining and assessing appropriateness of a homogeneous risk group 
Insurance and reinsurance undertakings should calculate technical provisions using 
homogeneous risk groups in order to derive assumptions.  
A ho mogeneous risk group encompasses a collection of policies with similar risk 
characteristics. In selecting a homogeneous risk group, undertakings should achieve an 
appropriate balance between the credibility of data available, to enable reliable statistical

Guideline 78 – Extent of allowance for future reinsurance purchase  
Insurance and reinsurance undertakings should recognise future cash -flows relating to future 
reinsurance purchasing covering obligat ions already recognised in the balance -sheet - to the 
extent that it is replacing any expiring reinsurance arrangements and if it can be demonstrated 
that it meets the conditions stated below:  
a) the insurance or reinsurance undertaking has a written policy on the replacement of the 
reinsurance arrangement;  
b) the replacement of the reinsurance arrangement does not take place more regularly than 
every 3 months;  
c) the replacement of the reinsurance arra ngement is not conditional on any future event 
which is outside of the control of the insurance or reinsurance undertaking. Where the 
replacement of the reinsurance arrangement is conditional on any future event, that is 
within the control of the insurance  or reinsurance undertaking, then the conditions should 
be clearly documented in the written policy referred to in point (a);  
d) the replacement of the reinsurance arrangement shall be realistic and consistent with the 
insurance or reinsurance undertaking’s current business practice and business strategy. 
The insurance or reinsurance undertaking shall be able to verify that the replacement is 
realistic through a comparison of the assumed replacement with replacements taken 
previously by the insurance or reinsurance undertaking;  
e) the risk that the reinsurance arrangement cannot be replaced due to capacity constraints 
is immaterial;  
f) an appropriate estimate of the future reinsurance premium to be charged is made which 
reflects the risk that the cost of replacing  existing reinsurance arrangements may increase;  
g) the replacement of the reinsurance arrangement is not contrary to the requirements that 
apply to future management actions set out in Article 236 of Commission Delegated 
Regulation 2015/35.

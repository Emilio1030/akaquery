Guideline 66 – Short term disruptions  
Where an active and transparent market does not temporarily satisfy one or more of the 
conditions of being deep and liquid and it is reasonably expected to meet again the conditions 
during the following three months, insurance and reinsurance undertakings should use prices 
that were observed during that period for the purposes of these Guidelines.  
Undertakings should asses that the use of these prices does not result in a material error in 
the valuation of the technical provisions.  
 
Guideline 67 – Unbundling of obligations valued as a whole  
Where under the same contract a number of future cash -flows exist which meet all the 
conditions in order to calculate the technical provision as whole and other future cash -flows 
which do not meet some of those conditions, insurance and reinsurance undertakings should 
unbundle both sets of cash- flows. For the first set of cash -flows, no separate calculation of the 
best estimate and the risk margin should be required but undertakings should be required to 
carry on a separate calculation for the second set of cash -flows. If the proposed unbundling is 
not feasible, in particular when there is significant interdependency between the two sets of 
cash flows, undertakings should be required to carry on separate calcula tions of the best 
estimate and the risk margin for the whole contract.  
 
Future premiums  
Guideline 68 – Future premium cash- flows versus premium receivable 
Insurance and reinsurance undertakings should establish the future premium cash -flows 
contained within the contract boundaries at the valuation date and include within the 
calculation of its best estimate liabilities those future premium cash -flows which fall due after 
the valuation date.  
Insurance and reinsurance undertakings should treat premiums which are due for payment by 
the valuation date as a premium receivable on its balance sheet until the cash is received.

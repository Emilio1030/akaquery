frequency of claims, the cases of a new insurance company or a new line of business, the 
small volume of the portfolio, the introduction of legal or other changes in the operating 
environment t hat may affect the adequacy of the historical data for the purpose of valuation 
of technical provisions or due to the heterogeneity in the information that may distort the identification of claims patterns on the basis of which a reliable estimate could be  derived.  
19. Undertakings should ensure that, if needed, the actuarial function uses appropriate 
approximations, including case by case approaches, which could imply the use of 
assumptions relying on expert judgment to data in order to allow valuation of tec hnical 
provisions.  
20. Some examples of the shortcomings in the internal processes of collecting, storing or validating data quality are: the presence of deficiencies in the internal processes due to IT 
mistakes, the high cost of collecting or maintaining existent data or a misinterpretation of 
what is necessary in achieving an appropriate valuation.  
21. The role of the actuarial function towards the correction of the shortcomings is limited to the identification of its source and to investigate how the deficienc y can be solved or at 
least attenuated and convey the conclusions obtained by specifying any relevant actions 
that could be carried out envisaging this purpose. Therefore, it is not expected that the 
actuarial function is required to carry out such actions  
 
Guideline 12 – Recommendations of the actuarial function 
Insurance and reinsurance undertakings should ensure that the actuarial function delivers 
recommendations to the management body on the procedures that could be performed in 
order to increase the q uality and the quantity of available data. To accomplish this task, the 
actuarial function should identify the sources of material limitations and propose possible 
solutions considering their effectiveness and the time necessary to implement them.  
 
Guideline 13 – Application of expert judgment upon material limitations  
Where there are material limitations to the data that cannot be remedied without undue 
complexity, insurance and reinsurance undertakings should ensure that expert judgment is 
applied to overcome these limitations to ensure that technical provisions are appropriately

accurate manner, insurance and reinsurance undertakings should be allowed to apply 
simplified methods to allocate the overall risk margin to the individual lines of business which 
are proportionate to the nature, scale and complexity of the risks involved. The methods 
applied should be consistent over time.  
Explanatory text  
150. As set out in Article 37 of the Implementing Measures, the risk margin shall be calculated 
taking into account diversification effect between lines of business. Consequently, the sum 
of the risk margin per line of business has to be equal to the risk margin for the whole 
business.  
151. A straightforward way to determine the margin per line of business is as follows: First, the 
risk margin is calculated for the whole business of the undertaking, allowing for diversification between lines of busines s. In a second step the margin is allocated to the 
lines of business.  
152. The allocation of the risk margin to the lines of business can also be done according to the contribution of the lines of business to the overall SCR during the lifetime of the business .  
153. The contribution of a line of business can be analysed by calculating the SCR under the assumption that the undertaking's other business does not exist. Where the relative sizes of the SCRs per line of business do not materially change over the lifetime  of the business, 
undertakings may apply the following simplified approach for the allocation:   
𝐶𝐶𝐶𝐶𝐶𝐶𝐶𝐶𝑙𝑙𝑙𝑙𝑙𝑙=𝑆𝑆𝐶𝐶𝑆𝑆𝑅𝑅𝑅𝑅,𝑙𝑙𝑙𝑙𝑙𝑙(0)
∑𝑆𝑆𝐶𝐶
𝑆𝑆𝑅𝑅𝑅𝑅,𝑙𝑙𝑙𝑙𝑙𝑙(0) 𝑙𝑙𝑙𝑙𝑙𝑙∗𝐶𝐶𝐶𝐶𝐶𝐶𝐶𝐶 , 
where  
CoCM lob  =  risk margin allocated to line of business (lob)  
SCR RU,lob(0)  =  SCR of the reference undertaking for line of business (lob) at t=0  
CoCM   =  risk margin for the whole business  
154. If it is not possible to argue that the SCR -ratios are reasonably stable over  time, it may be 
necessary to carry out some more detailed calculations. A possible approach may be to use 
the simplifications described to risk margin calculations (see Guideline 62) for the individual 
lines of business as well. If this approach is chosen, it will in general be necessary to introduce an additional adjustment (i.e. find a scaling factor) in order to ensure that the sum of risk margins allocated to the individual lines of business equals the overall risk 
margin.

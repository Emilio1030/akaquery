percentage to be used for a given line of business, the undertaking should take into account 
that this percentage is likely to increase if the modified duration of the insurance liabilities â€“ 
or some other measure of the run -off pattern of these liabilities - increases.  
Undertakings should give due consideration to the very simplistic nature of this approach; it 
should be used only where it has been demonstrated that none of the more sophisticated risk 
margin approaches in the above hierarchy can be applied.  
When undertakings rely on this method for the calculation of the risk margin, they will need 
to justify and document the rationale for the percentages used by line of business. This 
justification and rationale should consider any specific characteristics of the portfolios being 
assessed. Undertakings should not use this method when negative best estimate values exist. 
 
Without prejudice to the proportionality assessment and the provisions in Article 58 of 
Commission Delegated Regulation 2015/35, insurance and reinsurance undertakings may use 
the simplifications defined in Technical Annex IV when applying the hierarchy of methods.  
Explanatory text  
141. It is noted that the distinction between the levels in the hierarchy sketched in the respective 
Guideline is not always clear -cut. This is e.g. the case for the distinction between the 
simplifications on level (2) and level (3). An example may be a proport ional method (based 
on the development of the best estimate technical provisions) applied for an individual module or sub -module relevant for the calculation of future SCRs for the reference 
undertaking. Such simplifications can be seen as belonging to either level (2) or level (3).  
142. The use of a simplification does not allow not considering all material market risk other than 
interest rate risk and not quantifying all such non -hedgeable risk in the calculation of the 
risk margin. In circumstances where und ertakings hedge their financial guarantees, material 
market risk will often pertain. This could, for example, include tracking error or timing error. Also, if a hedging program has been devised based on assumed future policyholder 
behaviour, then changes f rom this expected future policyholder behaviour can be identified 
as an example of material market risk.  
143. With respect to Method 1): This approach would require focusing on the individual modules 
or sub -modules in order to approximate the individual risks and/or sub -risks being relevant 
for the following modules:  
a) underwriting risk (life, health and non -life, respectively);

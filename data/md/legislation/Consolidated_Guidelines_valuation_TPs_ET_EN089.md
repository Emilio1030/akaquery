𝐶𝐶𝐶𝐶𝐶𝐶  = the Cost -of-Capital rate.  
 
Where 𝑆𝑆𝐶𝐶𝑆𝑆𝑅𝑅𝑅𝑅(0) includes material sub -risks that will not exist over the whole lifetime of the 
portfolio (fo r example non -life premium risk for unexpired contracts or material market risk), the 
calculation can often be improved by  
 
• excluding these subrisks from 𝑆𝑆 𝐶𝐶𝑆𝑆𝑅𝑅𝑅𝑅(0) for the above calculation;  
• calculating the contribution of these subrisks to the risk mar gin separately;  
• aggregating the results (where practicable allowing for diversification).  
 With respect to level (4) of the hierarchy:  
 
According to this simplification the risk margin 𝐶𝐶𝐶𝐶𝐶𝐶𝐶𝐶  is calculated as a percentage of the best 
estimate technica l provisions net of reinsurance at 𝑡𝑡=0, that is  
 
𝐶𝐶𝐶𝐶𝐶𝐶𝐶𝐶 =𝛼𝛼
𝑙𝑙𝑙𝑙𝑙𝑙∙𝐼𝐼𝑈𝑈𝑁𝑁𝑛𝑛𝑡𝑡(0) 
 
where  
 
𝐼𝐼𝑈𝑈𝑁𝑁𝑛𝑛𝑡𝑡(0) = the best estimate technical provisions net of reinsurance as assessed at time t=0 for the 
undertaking’s portfolio of (re)insurance obligations within  the given line of business;  
 
𝛼𝛼𝑙𝑙𝑙𝑙𝑙𝑙 = a fixed percentage for the given line of business.

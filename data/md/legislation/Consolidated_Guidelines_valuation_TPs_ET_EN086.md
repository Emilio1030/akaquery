Technical Annex III - Simplification for premium provisions  
 
Simplification to derive the best estimate for premium provision based on an estimate of the combined ratio in the line of business in question :  
 The following input information is required:  
(a) estimate of the combined ratio (CR) for the line of business during the run -off period of the 
premium provision;  
(b) present value of future premiums for the underlying obligations (as to the extent to which future premiums fall within the contract boundaries);  
(c) volume measure for unearned premiums; it relates to business that has incepted at the valuation date and represents the premiums for this incepted business less the premiums that have already been earned against these contracts (determined on a pro rata temporis basis).  
 The best estimate is derived from the input data as follows:  
 
𝐼𝐼𝑈𝑈=𝐶𝐶
𝑆𝑆 ∙𝑉𝑉
𝐶𝐶+(𝐶𝐶
𝑆𝑆−1)∙𝑃𝑃𝑉𝑉𝑃𝑃𝑃𝑃+𝐴𝐴𝑈𝑈𝑆𝑆 ∙𝑃𝑃𝑉𝑉𝑃𝑃𝑃𝑃

𝐼𝐼𝑈𝑈 = b
est estimate of premium provision.  
𝐶𝐶
𝑆𝑆 = es
timat e of combined ratio for line of business on a gross of acquisition cost basis i.e. CR = 
(claims + claim related expenses) / (earned premiums gross of acquisition expenses).  
𝑉𝑉
𝐶𝐶 = v
olume measure for unearned premium. It relates to business that has incepted at the 
valuation date and represents the premiums for this incepted business less the premium that has already been earned against these contracts. This measure should be calculated gross of acquisition expenses.  
𝑃𝑃𝑉𝑉𝑃𝑃𝑃𝑃 = p
resent value of future prem iums (discounted using the prescribed term structure of risk -
free interest rates) gross of commission.  
𝐴𝐴𝑈𝑈𝑆𝑆 = es
timate of acquisition expenses ratio for line of business.  
 T
he combined ratio for an accident year (= occurrence year) is defined as the ratio of expenses and 
incurred claims in a given line of business or homogeneous group of risks over earned premiums. 
The earned premiums should exclude prior year adjustment. The expenses should be those 
attributable to the premiums earned other than claims  expenses. Incurred claims should exclude 
the run -off result, that is they should be the total for losses occurring in year y of the claims paid 
(including claims expenses) during the year and the provisions established at the end of the year. Alternatively, if it is more practicable, the combined ratio for an accident year may be considered to be the sum of the expense ratio and the claims ratio. The expense ratio is the ratio of expenses (other than claims expenses) to written premiums, and the expenses a re those attributable to the 
written premiums. The claims ratio for an accident year in a given line of business or homogeneous group of risks should be determined as the ratio of the ultimate loss of incurred claims over earned premiums.

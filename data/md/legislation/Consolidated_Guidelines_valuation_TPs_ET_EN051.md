use other market prices paying atte ntion to any distortions and ensuring that adjustments to 
overcome those distortions are made in a deliberate, objective and reliable manner.  
Insurance and reinsurance undertakings should be able to demonstrate that the choice of 
financial instruments used in the calibration process is relevant given the characteristics of the 
insurance or reinsurance obligations (e.g. embedded options and financial guarantees).  
 
Guideline 57A – Market risk factors needed to deliver appropriate results  
When assessing whether all the relevant risk factors are modelled with respect to the 
provisions of Articles 22(3) and 34(5) of the Delegated Regulation, insurance and reinsurance 
undertakings should be able to demonstrate that their modelling adequately reflec ts the 
volatility of their assets and that the material sources of volatility are appropriately reflected 
(e.g. spreads and default risk).  
In particular, insurance and reinsurance undertakings should use models that allow for the 
modelling of negative inte rest rates.  
Explanatory text  
140. Insurance and reinsurance undertakings should ensure that any risk factor that could have 
a material impact on the outcome of the stochastic valuation is properly modelled. In 
particular, negative interest rates usually have a material impact and therefore  the models 
used should allow them in any case. However, other risk factors as spreads and default risk 
only have a material impact in some specific cases (e.g. where the investment strategy 
includes a material part of high -yield bonds) and  it may not be n ecessary to model them.  
 
Guideline 58 – Tests (accuracy, robustness and market -consistency)  
When insurance or reinsurance undertakings use an ESG for the stochastic modelling of the 
technical provisions, they should be able to demonstrate to the relevant s upervisory 
authorities the accuracy, robustness and market consistency properties of the ESG. A measure 
of the accuracy of the ESG (at least a Monte Carlo error analysis) should be assessed.

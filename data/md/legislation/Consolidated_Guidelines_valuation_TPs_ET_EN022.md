Insurance and reinsurance undertakings should ensure, when assessing whether a method 
that assumes that biometric risk factors are independent from any other variable is 
proportionate, and that the specificities of the risk fa ctors are taken into account. For this 
purpose, the assessment of the level of correlation should be based on historical data and 
expert judgment.  
Explanatory text  
46. For large portfolios where it could be assumed that the law of large numbers causes the 
variation to be rather narrowly spread around the mean, except possibly for the trend forecast for which the error is not diversifiable within a line of business, a det erministic 
approach could be proportionate to model the uncertainty of biometric risk factors.  
47. The consideration of expected future changes in biometrical risk factors is particularly 
relevant for contracts with long term or long tail liabilities. Therefore, the application of a 
simplification neglecting expected future changes in biometrical risk factors to insurance contracts with short/medium term or short/medium liabilities should, in principle, not give 
rise to any material error. However, if the undertaking has a large portfolio of long term 
contracts, e.g. annuities, or contracts with long tail liabilities, then simply neglecting expected future changes or, more specifically future trends, will not be appropriate. This does not mean however that the undertaking needs to follow a stochastic approach to 
model trends, as other simpler alternatives may be available.  
48. The decision under which situation it will be appropriate to use a simplification assuming 
that biometric risk factors are independent from any other variable will depend on the specific risk factors it is referring to. If two risk factors are highly correlated then assuming independence will potentially give rise to a material error. But for risk factors which have a 
low impact on biometric risk factors, assuming independence can be considered 
appropriate.  
49. Further examples of simplified methods for biometric risk factors are the use of group of cohorts or period data to analyse biometric risk factors or the application of current tables in use adjusted by suitable multiplier functions.

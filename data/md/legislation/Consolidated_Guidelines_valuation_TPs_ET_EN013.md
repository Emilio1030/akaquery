function knows and considers in its analysis the reliab ility of the sources of information and 
the consistency and stability of its process of collecting and publishing information over time.  
Moreover, undertakings should ensure that the actuarial function considers all the realistic 
assumptions and relevant methodologies applied to derive data, including any adjustments or 
simplifications applied to raw data. The actuarial function should be aware of and take into 
consideration if any changes that have been applied over time to external data, whether those 
changes relate to assumptions or associated methodologies or any other procedures regarding 
the collection of external data.  
Moreover, whenever it is accessible and adequate, undertakings should ensure that the 
actuarial function measures the quality of available data in the context of provisioning analysis 
in regard to available industry or market data which is deemed comparable, and in particular 
to the requirements set in Article 76(3) of Solvency II. Any material deviations should be 
identified and underst ood by the actuarial function. This analysis could refer to the specificities 
of the particular homogeneous risk group being valued.  
Explanatory text  
27. The actuarial function needs to consider any adjustments that may have been introduced 
in raw market data (data actually observed without any type of corrections or adjustments) 
and be aware of the materiality of the difference between the raw observations and the final data set collected in order to evaluate the potential impact that such differences would 
have in the result of technical provisions and if material, whether it improves how well the 
undertakingâ€™s risk profile is represented. Furthermore, the actuarial function has to know 
the main motivations for this introduction, meaning that the actuarial fun ction is supposed 
to understand the information to be given as input in the calculation of technical provisions 
comprising the main relevant processes of data transformation that it may have been 
through in order to perform a realistic assessment of the level of quality of this information.  
28. The adjustments may be the result of several motivations, e.g., the increase of consistency between different periods of time. Such adjustments may be the result of the application of assumptions in line with the methodologies to be applied or be introduced more or less 
independently of the methods to be used, and related to data themselves (which is the case 
of the example given above).

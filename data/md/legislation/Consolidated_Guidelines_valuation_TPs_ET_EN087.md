Technical Annex IV - Hierarchy of simplifications for the risk margin  
 
With respect to level (1) of the hierarchy:  
 
Life Underwriting Risk  
 The simplifications allowed for the SCR -calculations in respect of mortality, longevity, disability risk, 
expense risk, revision risk and catastrophe risk carry over to the risk margin calculations. Health 
Underwriting Risk The simplifications allowed for the SCR calculations in respect of health mortality, 
health longevity, medical expense disability -morbidity, income protection disability morbidity, 
health expense and SLT health lapse risks carry over to the risk margin calculations.   
Non -life Underwriting Risk  
 The calculation of the future SCRs related to premium and reserve risk could be somewhat simplified if renewals and future business are not taken into account:  
 
• If the premium volume in year 𝑡𝑡 is small compared to the reserve volume, then the 
premium volume for the year 𝑡𝑡  can be set to 0. An example may be business 
comprising no multiple -year contracts, where the premium volume can be set to 0 
for all future years t where 𝑡𝑡 ≥ 1.  
• If the premium volume is zero, then the capital charge for non -life underwriting can 
be approximated by the formula:  
 
3∙𝜎𝜎(𝑟𝑟𝑛𝑛𝑙𝑙,𝑚𝑚𝑙𝑙𝑟𝑟)∙ 𝑃𝑃𝐶𝐶𝑅𝑅𝑁𝑁𝑛𝑛𝑡𝑡(𝑡𝑡) 
 w
here  
 
𝜎𝜎(𝑟𝑟𝑛𝑛𝑙𝑙,𝑚𝑚𝑙𝑙𝑟𝑟) represents the aggregated standard deviation for reserve risk and 𝑃𝑃𝐶𝐶𝑅𝑅𝑁𝑁𝑛𝑛𝑡𝑡(𝑡𝑡) the best 
estimate provision for claims outstanding net of reinsurance in year 𝑡𝑡.  
 
T
he aggregated standard deviation for reserve risk 𝜎𝜎 (𝑟𝑟𝑛𝑛𝑙𝑙,𝑚𝑚𝑙𝑙𝑟𝑟) could be calculated using the 
aggregation steps as described in Articles 117 of Commission Delegated Regulation 2015/35, assuming all the amounts relating to premium risk are equal to zero.  
 A
s a further simplification it can be assumed that the undertaking- specific estimate of the standard 
deviation for premium risk and reserve risk remains unchanged throughout the years.  
 
Also the underwriting risk charge fo r catastrophe risk is taken into account only with respect to the 
insurance contracts that exist at 𝑡𝑡 =  0. 
 
Counterparty Default  Risk  
 
The counterparty default risk charge with respect to reinsurance ceded can be calculated directly from the definition for each segment and each year. If the exposure to the default of the reinsurers

-  The assumptions used to estimate best estimate liabilities can be grouped into economic and 
non-economic (insurance) assumptions. Economic assumptions can be in the form of an 
Economic Scenario Generator (ESG) file or a set of deterministic scenarios.  
 
Guideline 85 – Qualitative and quantitative approaches  
Insurance and reinsurance undertakings should require the actuarial function to ensure that 
the validation process covers both quantitative and qualitative aspects and goes beyond a 
comparison of estimates with outcomes. It should also include qualitative aspects such as 
assessment of controls, documentation, interpretation and communication of results.  
 
Guideline 86 – Regular and dynamic validation process  
Insurance and reinsurance undertakings should require the actuarial function to perform a 
regular and  dynamic process in which it periodically refines validation approaches to 
incorporate experience gained from carrying out the previous validations and in response to 
changing market and operating conditions.  
 
Guideline 87 – Comparison against experience – deviations  
Insurance and reinsurance undertakings should ensure that the actuarial function:  
a) identifies the total deviation between expected and actual claims experience;  
b) splits the total deviation into its main sources and analyses the reaso ns behind the 
deviation;  
c) if the deviation does not appear to be a temporary aberration, makes recommendations 
on the changes to the model or assumptions used.  
Undertakings should ensure that relevant market data and trends are considered as a part of 
the comparison against experience.

111. Generally, the proportionality of any given valuation technique will depend on the 
individual risk situation of the insurer. Therefo re, the criteria laid out in this guideline are 
intended to give guidance to the actuarial function in their assessment of the 
appropriateness of a given technique. It cannot provide a definite decision whether the 
technique is admissible as this also depe nds on the undertaking’s specificities.

c) the cash -flows are materially affected by the potential future management actions;

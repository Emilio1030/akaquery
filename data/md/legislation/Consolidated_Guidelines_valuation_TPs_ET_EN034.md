Guideline 37A â€“ Dynamic policyholder behaviour  
Insurance and reinsurance undertakings should base their assumptions on the exercise rate of 
relevant options on:  
- statistical and empirical evidence, where it is representative of future conduct, and  
- expert judgment on sound rationale and with clear documentation.  
The lack of data for extreme scenarios should not be considered alone to be a reason to avoid 
dynamic policyholder behaviour modelling and/or the interaction with future management 
actions.  
Explanatory text  
95. The most commonly modelled dynamic policyholder behaviour relates to surrender  
options. For example, in this case, undertakings can measure the financial gain/loss that the 
policyholder would face by surrendering the contract early or keeping the contract on, by comparing the current credited return with the benchmark return after recognizing any 
surrender penalties and future discretionary profit sharing. It should be acknowledged that 
the average policyholder may not actively manage their insurance products as part of an investment portfolio under such a purely economic view. On th e other hand, the projection 
horizon for savings product can be relatively long (several tens of years) and the hypothesis 
that the future behaviour will remain identical to the past might be subject to discussion.  
96. Dynamic lapse is path -dependent and so va ries within the stochastic scenarios, where it is 
particularly relevant. The benchmark return should be defined with reference to the investment conditions that prevail in the given scenario being considered.  
97. At the same time, since there is usually little  or no evidence in terms of the experienced 
reaction of policyholders to extreme financial conditions as the ones included in the set of 
stochastic scenarios, the lack of this data should not be considered alone to be a good 
reason to avoid dynamic policyh older behaviour modelling. In such cases, expert judgement 
can complement the available data to model the dynamic behaviour.  
98. Moreover, as part of an adequate dynamic modelling, undertakings should properly 
consider the interaction between the relevant futu re management actions and the 
policyholder behaviour (e.g. policyholder behaviour in terms of surrender levels can be linked to the comparison between contract return and a return offered by the market, where contract return is directly influenced by manag ement actions).

b) counterparty default risk with respect to ceded reinsurance and special purpose 
vehicles (SPVs);  
c) material market risk.  
in order to investigate to what extent the calculations could be simplified or approximated.  
144. With respect to Method 2): Simplifications classified as belonging to this level of the 
hierarchy are in general based on an assumption that the future SCRs for a given line o f 
business are proportional to the best estimate technical provisions for this line of business 
and the relevant year â€“  the proportionality factor being the ratio of the present SCR to the 
present best estimate technical provisions for the same line of bus iness (as calculated by 
the reference undertaking).  
145. This simplification is not considered proportionate for negative best estimate values at 
valuation date or at following dates, as it would lead to meaningless results for the Risk 
Margin (i.e. negative R isk Margin).  
146. With respect to Method 3): A representative example of a simplification belonging to this 
level of the hierarchical structure is using information regarding the modified duration of the liabilities in order to calculate the present and all fu ture SCRs in one single step.  
147. This approach applies also to SLT and some non -life obligations (e.g. non -life annuities).  
148. The simple example below has been put forward to show that even in case of reasonable 
in- and outgoing cash -flows the calculated valu e of the modified duration may be 
meaningless.

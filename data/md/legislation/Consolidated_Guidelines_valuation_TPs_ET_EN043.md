116. In assessing what is proportionate, the focus must be on the combination o f all three criteria 
- nature, scale and complexity - to arrive at a solution that is adequate to the risk an 
undertaking is exposed to. For instance, a business may be small -scale but could still include 
complex risk -profiles, or, on the contrary, it may be large -scale with a simple risk profile. In 
the first case, it cannot be allowed to use simplified methods while the possibility may be 
considered in the second case under very specific circumstances.  
117. The three indicators are strongly interrelated, and for the purpose of assessing their 
combination, it may be helpful to broadly categorize the risks according to the two dimensions “scale” and “complexity/predictability”:  
 
 
Guideline 48 – Granularity of materiality assessment  
Insurance and reinsurance undertakings should determine the most appropriate level at which 
an assessment of materiality for the purposes of the calculation of the technical provisions is 
to be carried out, which could be the individual homogeneous risk groups, the individual lines 
of business or the business of the insurer as a whole.  
Undertakings should consider when assessing the materiality that a risk which is immaterial 
with regard to the business of the insurer as a whole may still have a significant impact within 
a smaller segment. 
In addition, undertakings should not analyse technical provisions in isolation but any effect on 
own funds and thus on the total solvency balance sheet as well as on the Solvency Capital 
Requirement should be taken into ac count in this assessment.

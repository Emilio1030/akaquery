Technical Annex V - Simplified calculation of recoverables  from reinsurance contracts and special 
purpose vehicles  
 
With respect to premium provisions:  
 
The Gross -to-Net simplifications referred to below in respect of provisions for claims outstanding, 
2), could also be used for the calculation of recoverables in respect of premium provisions, i.e. the provisions for (covered but not incurred) claims related to the current accident year (where i=n+1), 
by using the (anticipated) proportional part of the reinsurance cover for this year. This will be a 
conservative  approach for the ceding (re)insurance undertaking, since the impact of the non -
proportional reinsurance for the current accident (business) year is not taken into account.  
 
With respect to provisions for claims outstanding:  
 
1) Gross -to-Net simplification based on provisions for RBNS -claims (“case reserves”) This 
simplification uses a ratio of net over gross provisions of an available portfolio A in order to estimate the net provisions of another portfolio B (NPB) based on the observable gross 
provisions of  portfolio B (GPB). In other words, the Gross-to -Net simplification (GN) is 
stipulated as:  
 
𝐺𝐺𝐼𝐼=𝐼𝐼𝑃𝑃
𝐴𝐴
𝐺𝐺𝑃𝑃
𝐴𝐴 
 
where NPA and GPA represents the net and gross provisions of portfolio A, respectively.  
Then this simplification is applied to calculate the net provisions for portfolio B as follows:  
 
𝐼𝐼𝑃𝑃
𝐼𝐼=𝐺𝐺𝐼𝐼 𝑥𝑥 𝐺𝐺𝑃𝑃
𝐼𝐼 
 T
he following criteria need to be fulfilled in order to apply this simplification:  
 - The benchmark portfolio (A) is similar to  the portfolio (B) for which the simplification is 
used, cf. the principle of substance over form.  
-  
- The ratio (GN) is established by means of credible and sustainable data. This requires a data set exceeding at least two years.  
 Ceded reinsurance varies with the size, the financial soundness and the risk aversion of a company, so that particular care is required when applying a ratio of net over gross from another benchmark portfolio. Such an approach can therefore only be used in cases where the benchmar k portfolio is known to have a very similar nature as the own portfolio. Even 
if this is the case, however, the cession percentage for non -proportional reinsurance will 
heavily depend on the actual occurrence of large losses, and therefore be very volatile . 
 
2) Gross -to-Net simplification based on cumulated paid claims (cumulated cash -flows)  This 
simplification derives an estimate of net provisions for claims outstanding by using the gross

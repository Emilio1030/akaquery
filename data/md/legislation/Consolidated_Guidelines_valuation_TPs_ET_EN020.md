seniority according to their m ateriality, for most material assumptions up to and including the 
administrative, management or supervisory body.  
 
Guideline 24C – Communication and uncertainty in assumptions setting  
Insurance and reinsurance undertakings should ensure that the processes around 
assumptions, and in particular around the use of expert judgement in choosing those 
assumptions, specifically attempt to mitigate the risk of misunderstanding or 
miscommunication between all different roles related to such assumptions.  
Insurance and  reinsurance undertakings should establish a formal and documented feedback 
process between the providers and the users of material expert judgement and of the resulting 
assumptions.  
Insurance and reinsurance undertakings should make transparent the uncert ainty of the 
assumptions as well as the associated variation in final results.  
 
Guideline 24D – Documentation of assumptions setting  
Insurance and reinsurance undertakings should document the assumption setting process 
and, in particular, the use of expert  judgement, in such a manner that the process is 
transparent.  
Insurance and reinsurance undertakings should include in the documentation the resulting 
assumptions and their materiality, the experts involved, the intended use and the period of 
validity. 
Insurance and reinsurance undertakings should include the rationale for the opinion, including 
the information basis used, with the level of detail necessary to make transparent both the 
assumptions and the process and decision -making criteria used for the se lection of the 
assumptions and disregarding other alternatives.

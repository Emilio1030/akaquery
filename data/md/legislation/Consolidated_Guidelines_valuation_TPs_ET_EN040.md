Section 4: Methodologies to calculate technical provisions  
Proportionality assessment  
Guideline 44 – General principle of proportionality  
Insurance and reinsurance undertakings should, in order to have an overall assessment of the 
risks underlying their insurance and reinsurance obligations, take into account the strong 
interrelation among the nature, scale and complexity of these risks.  
Undertakings should ensure that the actuarial function is able to explain which methods are 
used to calculate the technical provisions and the reason why such methods have been 
selected.

appropriateness and completeness of data considering the methodologies which are most

within other relevant analysis;  
b) the reporting of any recommendations on the implementation of improvements in the 
internal procedures that are  considered relevant to improve the compliance with the 
criteria as set out in point a);  
c) the identification of cases where additional external data are needed;

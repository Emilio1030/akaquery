Method 2  
To approximate the whole Solvency Capital Requirement for each fut ure year as referred in 
Article 58 (a)of Commission Delegated Regulation 2015/35, inter alia by using the ratio of the 
best estimate at that future year to the best estimate at the valuation date.  
This method is not appropriate when negative best estimate values exist at valuation date or 
subsequent dates.  
This method takes into account the maturity and the run -off pattern of the obligations net of 
reinsurance. Consequently, some considerations should be given regarding the manner in 
which the best estima te of technical provisions net of reinsurance has been calculated. Further 
consideration should be given as well as to whether the assumptions regarding the risk profile 
of the undertaking can be considered unchanged over time. This includes: 
a) For all underwriting risks, to consider if the composition of the subrisks in underwriting 
risk is the same;  
b) For counterparty default risk, to consider if the average credit standing of reinsurers and 
special purpose vehicles is the same;  
c) For market risk, to consider  if the material market risk in relation to the net best estimate 
is the same;  
d) For operational risk, to consider if the proportion of reinsurers' and special purpose 
vehicles share of the obligations is the same;  
e) For adjustment, to consider if the loss absorbing capacity of the technical provisions in 
relation to the net best estimate is the same.  
If some or all of these assumptions do not hold, the undertaking should carry out at least a 
qualitative assessment of how material the deviation from the assumptions is. If the impact of 
the deviation is not material compared to the risk margin as a whole, then this method can be 
used. Otherwise the undertaking should either adjust the formula appropriately or be 
encouraged to use a more sophisticated method.  
Method 3 
To approximate the discounted sum of all future Solvency Capital Requirements in a single step 
without approximating the Solvency Capital Requirements for each future year separately as

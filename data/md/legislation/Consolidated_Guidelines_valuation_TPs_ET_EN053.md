Calculation of the risk margin  
Guideline 61 – Methods to calculate the risk margin  
Insurance and reinsurance undertakings should assess whether a full projection of all future 
Solvency Capital Requirements is necessary in order to reflect the nature, scale and complexity 
of the risks underlying the reference undertaking's insurance and reinsurance obligations in a 
proportionate manner. In such case, undertakings should carry out these calculations. 
Otherwise, alternative methods may be used to calculate the risk margin, ensuring that the 
method chosen is adequate to capture the risk profile of the undertaking.  
Where simplified methodologies are used to calculate the best estimate, the undertakings 
should assess the consequent impact that the use of such methodologies may have on the 
methods available to calculate the risk margin, including the use of any simplified methods for 
projecting the future SCRs.  
 
Guideline 6 2 – Hierarchy of methods for the calculation of the risk margin  
When deciding which level of the hierarchy set out below is most appropriate, insurance and 
reinsurance undertakings should ensure that the complexity of the calculations does not go 
beyond what is necessary in order to reflect the nature, scale and complexity of the risks 
underlying the reference undertaking's insurance and reinsurance obligations in a 
proportionate  manner.  
Undertakings should apply the hierarchy of methods consistently with the framework set out 
when defining the proportionality principle and the necessity of assessing risks properly.  
Insurance and reinsurance undertakings should use the following hierarchy as a decision 
making basis regarding the methods to be used for projecting future Solvency Capital 
Requirements:  
Method 1  
To approximate the individual risks or sub- risks within som e or all modules and sub- modules 
to be used for the calculation of future Solvency Capital Requirements as referred to in Article 
58(a) of Commission Delegated Regulation 2015/35.

22. Even if the portfolio of an undert aking is big enough to derive statistically valid evidence 
regarding lapse and biometrics, market and competitor’s developments, trends, as well as 
information provided by national actuarial associations, trade bodies, etc. may be considered in the valuati on of technical provisions. Expert judgment accompanies this 
process to decide if data has to be adjusted.  
23. To overcome data limitations, expert judgment can be applied to modify data, exclude outliers as well as to supplement data. Careful attention shall be paid to data outliers with 
a view to deciding that they are not relevant to consideration of future models and assumptions, or ensuring that the models and assumptions for the future make adequate 
provision for the possibility of such events occurring again, or other rare events occurring, 
with appropriate regard to frequency and severity.  
24. The application of expert judgment is always applied in conjunction with available internal and external information. Where expert judgment is used to overcome mater ial data 
limitations, the data source that is available also needs to be analysed as a source of 
information.

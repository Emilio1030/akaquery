homogeneous risk groups to individual policies or grouped policies, where the groupings may 
be more granular than homogeneous risk groups.

33. Key factors in assessing credibility of data within a potential homogeneous risk group 
include availability of sufficient historical information to identify trends and assess the 
characteristics of the underlying risks. 2.26. Homogeneous risk groups may ch ange in the 
long run as the portfolio composition changes and requires further granularity of treatment. 
55/95 2.27. Some policies may have different coverage, e.g. a motor policy may cover own 
damage and liability which requires allocation into separate h omogeneous risk groups. 
2.28. Homogeneous risk groups for outwards reinsurance business are expected to be consistent with underlying business but this does not imply that the same homogeneous 
risk groups need to be used for both.  
 
Guideline 21 – Unbundling of insurance or reinsurance contracts covering multiple risks  
Where an insurance or reinsurance contract covers risks across different lines of business, 
unbundling of the obligations is not required where only one of the risks covered by the 
contract is material. In this case, the obligations relating to the contract should be segmented 
according to the major risk driver.  
 
Guideline 22 – Granularity of segmentation  
Insurance and reinsurance undertakings should analyse whether the granularity of the 
segmentation of insurance or reinsurance obligations adequately reflects the nature of the 
risks. This segmentation should consider the policyholder’s right to profit participation, 
options and guarantees embedded in the contracts and the relevant risk  drivers of the 
obligations.

35. In order to ensure that appropriate assumptions are used, it is important that the assumptions are based on homogeneous data to avoid introducing distortions which might

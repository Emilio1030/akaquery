Calculation of technical provisions as a whole  
Guideline 64 – Capturing uncertainty  
Insurance and reinsurance undertakings should understand by the consideration of the 
uncertainty in order to reliably replicate the future cashflows associated with insurance or 
reinsuran ce obligations that the cash -flows of the financial instruments must not provide only 
the same expected amount as the cash -flows associated with insurance or reinsurance 
obligations, but also the same patterns of variability.  
 
Guideline 65 – Reliable repli cation 
Insurance and reinsurance undertakings should not consider future cash- flows associated with 
insurance or reinsurance obligations to be reliably replicated if:  
a) One or several features of the future cash -flow, inter alia its expected value, its volat ility 
or any other feature, depend on risks whose specific pattern in the undertaking cannot be 
found in instruments actively traded in financial markets;  
b) Current trade and price information are not normally readily available to the public, due 
to the fact that one or several features of the future cash -flow depend to any extent on 
the development of factors specific to the undertakings, such as expenses or acquisition 
costs; or,  
c) One or more features of the future cash -flow depend on the development of fac tors 
external to the undertaking for which there are no financial instruments for which reliable 
market values are observable.  
Explanatory text  
155. Today no reliable market exists for the replication of the characteristics of biometric -
dependent cash -flows.  
156. The following examples do not intend to be an exhaustive list. The treatment of non -listed 
cases need to be assessed in the light of the relevant legal provisions, the guidelines specific 
to the calculation of technical provisions as a whole and the criteria illustrated with the following examples, avoiding interpretations ‘a sensu contrario’.

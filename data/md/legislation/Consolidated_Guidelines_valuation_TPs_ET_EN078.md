202. In many cases, in particular if the counterparty is of good credit quality, the adjustment for 
counterparty default will be rather small compared to the reinsurance recoverables. At the 
same time, a sophisticated calculation of the adjustment can be a very complex task. In order to reduce the burden of the calculation of the adjustment on the undertaking, Article 73 of the Implementing Measures provides a simplification for the calculation of the 
adjustment.  
 
General Principles in respect of methodologies to calculate technical provisions  
Guideli ne 8 2 â€“ The projection period  
When assessing whether the projection period and the timing of cash -flows to the 
policyholders during the year is proportionate, insurance and reinsurance undertakings should 
at least take into account  the following characteristics:  
a) the degree of the homogeneity of the cash -flows;  
b) the level of uncertainty i.e. the extent to which future cash flows can be estimated;  
c) the nature of the cash -flows.

203. Where expert judgment is applied to der ive assumptions or to decide on a method to be 
used to calculate technical provisions, the available data source needs to be taken into 
account in this respect. In particular, where expert judgment was used to overcome data limitations, expert judgment app lied when deciding on a method ensures that technical 
provisions are calculated accurately in a realistic, verifiable and justifiable manner.  
204. Expert judgment in respect of assumptions on segmentation may be based on deep 
knowledge of statutory and regulat ory terms, contractual terms (including options and 
guarantees included in the contracts) and reasonable policyholder expectations.  
205. Possible simplifications are to assume that:  
- the projection period is one year or that;  
- cash -flows to the policyholders o ccur either at the end of the year or in the middle of 
the year.

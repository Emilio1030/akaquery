Explanatory tex t 
188. In the calculation of the best estimate at the valuation date, undertakings can allow for 
future management actions to enter into reinsurance contracts protecting their in force 
business. The calculation of the benefits will require that undertakings ide ntify in respect 
of the reinsurance contract to be entered into:  
a) the amount of premium to be charged;  
b) the coverage to be provided;  
c) the risk of counterparty default that results from the arrangement.  
189. We expect that the inclusion of future reinsurance wou ld increase the net of reinsurance 
technical provisions, as we would expect that the reinsurance premium to be paid would be greater than the reinsurance recoveries obtained on a best estimate basis.  
190. The premium to be charged for the reinsurance arrangement should include the future 
business falling within the contract boundary of the insurance and reinsurance contracts to 
which the amounts recoverable relate.  
191. The approach for dealing with future reinsurance for the purposes of estimating the technical pr ovisions needs to be consistent with the treatment of future reinsurance for the 
purposes of the SCR calculation  
 
Guideline 79 – Simplified calculation of recoverables from reinsurance  contracts and special 
purpose vehicles – premium provisions  
In order t o estimate the amount of reinsurance recoverable from the gross of reinsurance 
premium provision amount where a simplified calculation is applied, insurance and 
reinsurance undertakings should apply a separate gross to net factor to the cash outflow and 
potentially undertakings should apply a different gross to net factor for the cash inflow. 
Undertakings should base the gross to net factor for the cash outflow on an examination of 
past claims events with consideration of the future reinsurance programme ap plicable. The 
gross to net factor for the cash inflow should be based on consideration of the relative gross 
and reinsurance premiums expected to be received and paid.  
Without prejudice to the provisions in the first paragraph of this guideline and the 
proportionality Assessment undertakings may apply the simplifications outlined in Technical 
Annex V.

Guideline 28 – Expenses taken into account on contractual terms  
Insurance and reinsurance undertakings should ensure that expenses that are determined by 
contracts between the undertaking and third parties are taken into account based on the 
terms of the contract. In particular, commissions arising from insurance contracts are 
considered based on the terms of the contracts between the undertakings and the sales 
persons, and expenses in respect of reinsurance are taken into account based on the contracts 
between the undertaking and its reinsurers.  
Explanatory text  
55. Expenses that will be incurred in servicing insurance and reinsurance obligations also 
include commissions that will have to be paid or commissions that are being returned in the 
case of cancellation (claw back) of the insurance contract. The assessment of  these 
expenses should be carried out based on the agreement between the insurance 
undertaking and the sales persons.  
56. Expenses that relate to the internal processes of the insurer for reinsurance and special 
purpose vehicles should be taken into account when calculating technical provisions.  
 
Guideline 28A – Investment Management Expenses  
Insurance and reinsurance undertakings should include in the best estimate administrative 
and trading expenses associated with the investments needed to service insuranc e and 
reinsurance contracts.  
In particular, for products whose terms and conditions of the contract or the regulation 
requires to identify the investments associated with a product (e.g. most  unit linked and index 
linked products, products managed in ring- fenced funds and products to which matching 
adjustment is applied), insurance and reinsurance undertakings should consider the 
investments.  
For other products, insurance and reinsurance undertakings should base the assessment on 
the characteristics of the  contracts.  
As a simplification, insurance and reinsurance undertakings may also consider all investment 
management expenses.

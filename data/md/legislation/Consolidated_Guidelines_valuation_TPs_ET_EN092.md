Technical Annex VI - Simplified calculation during the year for the risk margin  
 
The Risk Margin at a given point in time during the forthcoming year (i.e. 𝐶𝐶𝐶𝐶𝐶𝐶𝐶𝐶𝐶𝐶𝐶𝐶𝐶𝐶 (𝑡𝑡)) could be 
calculated as follows:  
 
𝐶𝐶𝐶𝐶𝐶𝐶𝐶𝐶 (𝑡𝑡)=𝐶𝐶𝐶𝐶𝐶𝐶𝐶𝐶 (0)∙𝐼𝐼𝑈𝑈𝑁𝑁𝑛𝑛𝑡𝑡(𝑡𝑡)
𝐼𝐼𝑈𝑈𝑁𝑁𝑛𝑛𝑡𝑡(0)   ,      0 < 𝑡𝑡< 1 
 where:  
 
𝐶𝐶𝐶𝐶𝐶𝐶𝐶𝐶 (0) = risk margin as calculated at time 𝑡𝑡= 0 for the reference undertaking’s portfolio of 
(re)insurance obligations,  
 
𝐼𝐼𝑈𝑈𝑁𝑁𝑛𝑛𝑡𝑡(𝑡𝑡) = best estimate technical provisions net of reinsurance as assessed at time 𝑡𝑡 ≥ 0 for the 
reference undertaking’s portfolio of (re)insurance obligations

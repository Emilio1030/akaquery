70. According to Article 31(2) of the Delegated Regulation “overhead expenses shall be 
allocated in a realistic and objective manner and on a consistent basis over time to the parts of the best estimate to which they relate”. This provision should als o be applied to all 
expenses where the expenses may not be directed to one single cost centre.  
71. The process of apportionment of expenses between the existing and the future business 
should be done in realistic and objective manner. This can be achieved by analysing the 
operations of the business. Expenses are calculated on the assumption of an on -going 
business basis. Based on these factors, the identification of appropriate expense drivers and relevant expense apportionment ratios can be determined.  
72. In ord er to consider expense data to be complete and appropriate, sufficient historical data 
should be available at a sufficiently granular level.  
73. Regarding long- term business strategies, when setting the undertaking itself or a specific 
portfolio into run -off, the undertakings should amend the expense assumptions accordingly. 
It is also possible that the insurance market has changed, so some insurance lines are no longer sold, in which case the change of the product portfolio should be taken into account 
in sett ing the assumptions. However, the expense assumptions should be based on recent 
analysis of the operations of the business. Expense assumptions should be realistic and not 
materially deviate from short term business strategies.  Expert judgement may be needed 
when determining the split between expenses before and after the valuation date.  
74. The undertakings should assume that there are extraordinary expenses every now and then. The allocation of future recurrent one- off expenses requires use of expert judgeme nt 
because the historical costs seldom reflect the future expense allocations. For example, 
there are almost always IT projects going on in insurance undertakings, but the annual 
contributions and cost centres vary.  
 
Guideline 31 – Changing the approach to  the split of overhead expenses  
Insurance and reinsurance undertakings should allocate overhead expenses to existing and 
future business on a consistent basis over time, and should only change the basis of allocation 
if a new approach better reflects the c urrent situation.

provisions for claims outstanding in combination with an estimate of t he impact of the 
reinsurance covers for the individual accident years.  
 
With respect to the rationale for using this simplification, it is noticed that for past accident 
years the reinsurance structure for an individual year is known and will (likely) not  change 
retroactively. Accordingly, a comparison of net over gross cumulated cash flows per line of 
business in the past –  differentiated by accident year – may be used to derive an estimate 
of the impact of proportional and nonproportional reinsurance for the individual accident 
year (i.e. a Gross -to-Net simplification for the individual accident year).  
 For each line of business the Gross -to-Net simplifications for the accident years not finally 
developed (GNi) are stipulated as follows:  
 
𝐺𝐺𝐼𝐼𝑃𝑃=𝐴𝐴𝐼𝐼𝐴𝐴𝑡𝑡,𝑃𝑃,𝑃𝑃−𝑃𝑃
𝐴𝐴𝐺𝐺𝑃𝑃𝐶𝐶𝑠𝑠𝑠𝑠 ,𝑃𝑃,𝑃𝑃−𝑃𝑃 
 where 𝐴𝐴𝐺𝐺𝑃𝑃𝐶𝐶𝑠𝑠𝑠𝑠 ,𝑃𝑃,𝑃𝑃−𝑃𝑃 and 𝐴𝐴𝐼𝐼𝐴𝐴𝑡𝑡,𝑃𝑃,𝑃𝑃−𝑃𝑃 represent the cumulated paid claims gross and 
net of reinsurance, respectively, and n is the latest accident year with observed values of these cash -flows. These simplifications are then used to calculate the net provisions for 
claims outstanding for the individual accident years, that is  
 
𝑃𝑃𝐶𝐶𝑅𝑅𝐼𝐼𝐴𝐴𝑡𝑡 ,𝑃𝑃=𝐺𝐺𝐼𝐼𝑃𝑃 ×𝑃𝑃𝐶𝐶𝑅𝑅𝐺𝐺𝑃𝑃𝐶𝐶𝑠𝑠𝑠𝑠,𝑃𝑃 
 where 𝑃𝑃𝐶𝐶𝑅𝑅𝐺𝐺𝑃𝑃𝐶𝐶𝑠𝑠𝑠𝑠,𝑃𝑃 and 𝑃𝑃𝐶𝐶𝑅𝑅𝐼𝐼𝐴𝐴𝑡𝑡 ,𝑃𝑃 represent the gross and net provisions for claim s 
outstanding for accident year i, respectively. In order to apply this simplification both gross and net cumulated paid claims (gross and net cash flows) per accident year need to be available for each line of business. For newer accident years and especially the last accident year (where i=n) the stipulated simplification might be a bit too high due to the fact that 
the IBNR claims are likely to constitute a large part of the provisions for claims outstanding. 
Accordingly, the stipulated simplification is  likely to lead to an overestimation of the net 
provisions in these cases.

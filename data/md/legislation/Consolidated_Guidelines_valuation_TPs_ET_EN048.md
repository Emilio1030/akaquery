Guideline 5 3 – Decision on methodology  
Insurance and reinsurance undertakings should ensure that the valuation of contractual 
options and financial guarantees is based on adequate, applicable and relevant actuarial and 
statistical methodologies taking into account the developments in this field . 
Undertakings should ensure that at least the following aspects are considered when deciding 
on a methodology to determine the value of contractual options and financial guarantees:  
a) The nature, scale and complexity of the underlying risks and their interdependence during 
the lifetime of the contracts;  
b) Possible insights into the nature of options and guarantees and their main drivers;  
c) A thorough examination on the necessity to include additional and intricate computational 
complexity;  
d) Justification on the appropriateness of the method.  
 
Guideline 53A – Use of stochastic valuation 
Insurance and reinsurance undertakings should use stochastic modelling for the valuation of 
technical provisions of contracts whose cash flows depend on future events and 
develo pments, in particular those with material options and guarantees.  
When assessing whether stochastic modelling is needed to adequately capture the value of 
options and guarantees, insurance and reinsurance undertakings should, in particular but not 
only, co nsider the following cases:  
- any kind of profit -sharing mechanism where the future benefits depend on the return of 
the assets;   
- financial guarantees (e.g. technical rates, even without profit sharing mechanism), in 
particular, but not only, where combined with options (e.g. surrender options) whose 
dynamic modelling would increase the present value of cash flows in some scenarios.

Guideline 24A – Materiality in assumptions setting  
Insurance and reinsurance undertakings should set assumptions and use expert judgment, in 
particular taking into account the materiality of the impact of the use of assumptions with 
respect to the following Guidelines on assumption setting and expert judgement.  
Insurance and reinsurance undertakings should assess materiality taking into account both 
quantitative and qualitative indicators and taking into consideration binary events, extreme 
events, and events that are not present in historical data. Insurance and reinsurance 
undertakings should overall evaluate the indicators considered.  
Explanatory text  
43. It is necessary to consider all potential events, including 'events not in data' and extreme 
events, also known as binary  events within a financial context, to ensure that the best 
estimate reflects an expected value of the outcomes of all possible scenarios, as opposed 
to something less, such as an expected value of the outcomes of all reasonably foreseeable 
scenarios.  
44. Examples of such events would include environmental issues such as global warming and 
legislative or political changes that might impact the sustainability of the business model – either by increasing claim amounts or by reducing the volumes of new business.  
45. Where there is a short history of representative data, the expert judgment on the amount 
of weight to be placed on events that are not in that data is more likely to be material.  
 
Guideline 24B – Governance of Assumptions setting  
Insurance and reinsurance undertakings should ensure that all assumption setting and the use 
of expert judgement in particular, follows a validated and documented process.  
Insurance and reinsurance undertakings should ensure that the assumptions are derived and 
used consistently over time and across the insurance or reinsurance undertaking and that they 
are fit for their intended use.

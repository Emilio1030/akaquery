Explanatory text  
136. Sensitivity analyses are not required when technical provisions for such contracts are 
calculated as a whole. However when technical provisions for such contracts are calculated as a best estimate + risk margin (for example for expenses according to art. 40(2)(c) of draft delegated acts), future fees charged from a fund or asset (fees may be a given percentage 
of the value of fund or of the premium received) and future investment management expenses with regard to fund or asset strongly depends of future value of fund or asset. So substantial increase or decrease of value of fund or asset may lead to change of future cash -
flows concerning fees and investment management expenses and it may lead to change of best estimate of technical provisions for such cash- flows.

PCO Net,k,i = GN k,i(ck,i)×PCO Gross,k,i ,  
198. where c k,i is a parameter -vector representing the relevant characteristics of the reinsurance 
programme for this combination of line of business and accident year.  
199. A rationale for introducing separate techniques for the individual development years or 
groups of development years may be that claims reported and settled at an early stage 
(after the end of the relevant accident year) in general have a claims distribution that differs from the distribution of claims reported and/or settled at a later stage. Accordingly, the 
impact of a given reinsurance programme (i.e. the ratio between expected claims payments 
on a net basis and expected claims payments on a gross basis) will differ between development years or groups of de velopment years.  
200. A rationale for introducing separate techniques for RBNS -claims and IBNR -claims may be 
that insurance undertakings in general will have more information regarding the RBNS -
claims and have accordingly to be able to stipulate the gross -to-net technique to be applied 
on the gross best estimate for RBNS -provisions in a more accurate manner. On the other 
hand the gross -tonet technique to be applied on the gross best estimate for IBNR -provisions 
is then likely to be stipulated in a less precise manner, especially if more sophisticated 
techniques are not available.  
201. Finally, a rationale for making a split between “large” claims and “small” claims may be that 
the uncertainties related to expected claim amounts on a net basis for claims classified as  
“large” may in some (important) cases be small or even negligible compared to the 
uncertainties related to the corresponding claim amounts on a gross basis. However, this 
supposition depends (at least partially) on the thresholds for separation of “large”  and 
“small” claims being fixed for the individual lines of business.  
 
Guideline 81 – Simplified calculation of the counterparty default adjustment  
The simplified calculation of the adjustment for counterparty default given in Article 61 of 
Commission Delegated Regulation 2015/35 being based on the assumption that the 
probability of default of the counterparty remains constant over time, insurance and 
reinsurance undertakings proposing to use this simplification should consider whether this 
assumption is realistic, taking into account the credit quality step of the counterparty and the 
modified duration of the amounts recoverable from reinsurance contracts and special purpose 
vehicles.

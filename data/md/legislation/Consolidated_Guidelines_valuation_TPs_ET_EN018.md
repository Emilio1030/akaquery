Expert judgement   
Explanatory text   
39. All new guidelines on expert judgement are identical to the guidelines on expert judgement 
included in the Guidelines on the use of internal models2 except for Guideline 24a – 
Materiality in assumptions setting, which has been slightly adapted to best estimate valuation.  
40. Moreover, insurance and reinsurance undertakings usually have more data for best estimate valuation than for solvency capital requirement valuation. Thus, even if the 
principles that are applicable for expert judgment in best estimate valuation and within 
internal models are similar, their implementation might slightly differ. For instance, it is expected that insurance and reinsuranc e undertakings mainly focus on the identification of 
material assumptions where expert judgment is needed and implement a proportionate 
framework in terms of documentation, governance or validation process for those 
assumptions only. In particular, the gov ernance and validation process might involve 
internal committees, senior executive committees or the administrative management and supervisory body depending on the predefined framework and the sensitivity of the best 
estimate calculation to some material assumptions relying on expert judgment.  
41. It is not possible to define specific criteria for assessing materiality of any expert judgment 
use case. However, this could usually be based on sensitivity tests with a percentage of variation of technical provisions or future profits. It could either be considered at portfolio 
level or for the whole calculation, depending on the nature of the assumption. One criteria 
might also be defined based on the users (e.g. would a significant change in an assumption set by expert judgment influence decisions taken by the management body - change in the 
program of reinsurance, change in the activities/products sold, etc.).  
42. Finally, the validation process regarding expert judgment might usually not be independent 
from the gen eral validation process that insurance and reinsurance undertakings 
implement to validate the calculation of the technical provisions in order to maintain and 
promote homogeneity and convergence. Thus, use of expert judgments should be fully integrated in the different steps of validation (e.g. internal committees, “clearance” 
committees or management committees) depending on the nature, complexity and 
materiality of the cases where expert judgment has been applied.

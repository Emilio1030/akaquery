d) risks have a significant asymmetric impact on the value of the cash -flows, in particular if 
contracts include material embedded options and guarantees or if there are complex 
reinsurance contracts in place;  
e) the value of options and guarantees is affected by the policyholder behaviour;  
f) the undertaking uses a complex risk mitigation instrument;  
g) a variety of covers of different nature are bundled in the contracts;  
h) the terms of the contracts are complex, inter alia, in terms of franchises, participations, 
inclusion and exclusion criteria of the cover.  
Explanatory text  
113. Nature and compl exity of risks are closely related, and for the purposes of an assessment 
of proportionality could best be characterized together. Indeed, complexity could be seen 
as an integral part of the nature of risks, which is a broader concept.  
114. The degree of compl exity and/or uncertainty of the risks are associated with the level of 
calculation sophistication and/or level of expertise needed to carry out the valuation. In general, the more complex the risk, the more difficult it will be to model and predict the future cash flows required to settle the obligations arising from the insured portfolio.  
115. Therefore, to appropriately analyse and quantify more complex and/or less predictable risks, more sophisticated and elaborated tools will generally be required as well as sufficient 
actuarial expertise.  
 
Guideline 47 – Assessment of scale of the risks  
Insurance and reinsurance undertakings should identify and use an interpretation of scale 
which is best suited to the specific circumstances of the undertaking and to the ri sk profile of 
its portfolio. Nevertheless, the assessment of “scale” should lead to an objective and reliable 
assessment. 
To measure the scale of risks undertakings should establish an undertaking- specific benchmark 
or reference level which leads to a relative rather than an absolute assessment number. For 
this purpose, risks may be considered in a range from small to large relative to the established 
benchmark.

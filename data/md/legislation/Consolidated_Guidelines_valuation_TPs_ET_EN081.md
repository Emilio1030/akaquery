4. Examples of approaches or processes that may be used in the validation of the outputs of 
models are:  
-  Analysis of movement : this is a comparison of actual surplus over the year with the expected 
surplus. The analysis can be grouped according to the drivers of surplus such as initial 
adjustments (impact of changes to model, methodology and data as well as any corrections 
made), new  business effect (this will occur when the best estimate liability of the new business is 
not the same as the assets backing the new business), economic and insurance variances 
(impact of difference between best estimate assumption and experience), capital  injections and 
any unexplained movements. The following process would be one way to undertake an analysis 
of movement:  
i.  Re-run the model used to calculate position at the beginning of this period;  
ii. Re-run model allowing for any initial adjustments (the d ifference between two runs is the 
impact of opening adjustments);  
iii. Re-run model updated for changes in non -economic assumption, the difference between 
subsequent runs is the impact of assumption change;  
iv. Roll forward model allowing for actual non -economic parameters, the difference between 
the last two runs is insurance variance;  
v. Roll forward model allowing for actual economic parameters, the difference between the 
last two runs is economic variance;  
vi. Re-run model updated for new business volumes, the diff erence between the last two 
runs is the impact of new business;  
vii. The difference between the results of the last run and the previous run is unexplained 
movements. The undertaking should be able to demonstrate the understanding of the 
causes of any deviatio n from expected experience and the underlying drivers of this 
deviation.  
Note that this method only tests the assumptions being varied and not the design of the model. Note that changing the order will change the size of the impact of each individual 
step.   
-  Parallel testing : this involves using simple but independent calculations to check the 
reasonableness of an output. An example of this is using a closed form formula such as Black -
Scholes to calculate the cost of guarantee and compare it to the cost o f guarantee produced by 
the model. Another example is independently calculating the value of simple liabilities (such as asset shares) and comparing it with that calculated by the model;  
-  Cash -flow checks : this involves (re)insurance undertakingâ€™s check s on sample cash -flows for 
reasonableness;

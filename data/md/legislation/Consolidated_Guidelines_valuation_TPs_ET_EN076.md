192. Estimates of premium provisions comprise terms relating to future claim events and terms 
relating to future premium receipts.  
193. In estimating reinsurance recoverables in respect of premium provisions, it may be appropriate to estimate separate gross to net factors for each of these components. 
Therefore:  
PP
Gross,k  = Claims Gross,k  - Premiums Gross,k  
Claims Net,k = GN k(cClaims,k )×Claims Gross,k  
Premiums Net,k = GN k(cPremiums,k )×Premiums Gross,k  
PPNet,k = Claims Net,k - Premiums Net,k  
194. Where PP Gross,k and PP Net,k represent the premium provisions, on a gross and net of 
reinsurance basis respectively. The gross- to-net factor may be derived for the claims and 
premium components of the premium provision separately.  
195. Where c Claims,k is a parameter representing the relevant characteristics of the reinsurance 
programme covering future claims events falling within the contract boundaries related t o 
line of business k at the balance sheet day and  
196. cPremiums,k is a parameter representing the relationship between the gross and net of 
reinsurance future premiums for the line of business k at the balance sheet day.  
 
Guideline 80 – Simplified calculation  of recoverables from reinsurance contracts and special 
purpose vehicles – provisions for claims outstanding  
With respect to the provisions for claims outstanding for reinsurance recoverables, insurance 
and reinsurance undertakings should use separate gros s-to-net techniques either for each 
accident year or for each underwriting year not finally developed for a given line of business 
or homogeneous risk group if appropriate.

197. Accordingly, the relationship between the best estimate on a gross basis (PCO Gross,k,i ), the 
best estimate on a net basis (PCO Net,k,i) and the gross -to-net factor (GN k,i(ck,i)) for line of 
business (or homogeneous risk group) k and accident year i can be represented in a somewhat simplified manner as follows:

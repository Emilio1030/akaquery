178. However, t his does not imply that the risk margin has to be also negative or zero. The risk 
margin measures the cost of capital across the entire run -off until the settlement of all 
claims and, for insurance business, the capital requirement will exceed the present value of 
future profits for some or all of this period, unless the contracts have been designed to avoid insurance risk transfer. Thus, the risk margin cannot be negative.  
179. Where negative premium provisions are not immaterial, estimating the risk margin us ing 
the simplification based on taking a proportion of technical provisions is unlikely to be an appropriate method. Having established an appropriate valuation of the risk margin, using the proportion of technical provisions proxy to estimate the risk margin for interim reporting purposes, may be appropriate if consideration is given to any changes in the 
relative proportion of negative premium provision in the total valuation of technical 
provisions. 
 
Calculation of Expected Profits in Future Premiums (EP IFP) 
Guideline 76 – Separation of insurance obligations  
For the purpose of  the calculation set out in Article 260 of Commission Delegated Regulation 
2015/35, insurance and reinsurance undertakings should split its insurance obligations into 
those attributable to already paid -in premiums and those attributable to premiums in resp ect 
of business in force which are receivable in the future.  
 
Guideline 77 – Assumptions used to calculate EPIFP   
For  the  purpose  of  calculating  the  technical  provisions  without  risk  margin under  the  
assumption  that  the  premiums  relating  t o  existing  insurance  and reinsurance  contracts  
that  are  expected  to  be received  in  the  future  are  not received,  insurance and reinsurance 
undertakings  should  apply  the  same  actuarial  method  used  to calculate the technical 
provisions without risk margin in accordance with Article 77 of the Solvency II Directive, with 
the following changed assumptions:  
a) policies should be treated as though they continue to be in force rather than being 
considered as surrendered;

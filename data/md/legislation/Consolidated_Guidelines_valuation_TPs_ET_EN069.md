Guideline 73 â€“ Considerations for claims costs projections  
Insurance and reinsurance undertakings should ensure that the assessment of the claims cash -
flows included in the premium provisions give appropriate consideration to the expected 
incidence and cost of future claims, including consideration of the likeliho od of infrequent, 
high severity claims and latent claims.  
Explanatory text  
173. The assessment of premium provisions need to give due consideration to the expected 
incidence and cost of infrequent and high- severity claims as well as high volume and low -
severity  claims. For some class of business it will be appropriate to give separate 
consideration to the likelihood and cost of future claims falling within more than one of the following categories of claims:  
- Attritional claims: high volume of low cost claims th at are routinely expected to occur;  
- Large claims: less frequent, higher cost claims that are routinely expected to occur but where the frequency of such claims can vary materially from period to period;  
- Aggregation claims: a large frequency of claims arising from single event that occur less 
than annually;  
- Binary events: very low frequency events giving rise to very large claims settlements;  
- Latent claims: claims that materialise many years after the original coverage period on risk-attaching policies.

analyses to be performed, and the homogeneity of risk characteristics within the group. 
Undertakings should define homogeneous risk groups in such a manner that those are 
expected to be reasonably stable over time.  
Where necessary, undertakings should for  the derivation of risks inter alia take into account 
the following items:  
a) underwriting policy;  
b) claims settlement pattern;  
c) risk profile of policyholders;  
d) product features, in particular guarantees;  
e) future management actions.  
Undertakings should ensure  consistency between the homogeneous risk groups it uses to 
assess its gross of reinsurance technical provisions and its reinsurance recoverables.

29. Key factors in assessing credibility of data within a potential homogeneous risk group 
inclu de availability of sufficient historical information to identify trends and assess the 
characteristics of the underlying risks.  
30. Homogeneous risk groups may change in the long run as the portfolio composition changes and requires further granularity of tre atment.  
31. Some policies may have different coverage, e.g. a motor policy may cover own damage and

32. Homogeneous risk groups for outwards reinsurance business are expected to be consis tent 
with underlying business but this does not imply that the same homogeneous risk groups 
need to be used for both.

Guideline 27 â€“ Availability of market data  
Insurance and reinsurance undertakings should assess the availability of relevant market data 
on expenses by considering the representativeness  of market data relative to the portfolio of 
insurance or reinsurance obligations, and the credibility and reliability of data.  
Explanatory text  
51. The assessment of the expenses that will be incurred in servicing insurance and reinsurance 
obligations consider data from external sources such as average industry or market data.  
52. Where average market information is used, consideration needs to be given as to the 
representativeness of the data used to form that average. For example, market information is not deemed to be sufficiently representative where the market information has material 
dispersion in representativeness of the portfolios whose data have been used to calculate 
such market information.  
53. The assessment of credibility considers the volume of data underlying the market 
information.  
54. The actuarial guideline on data quality standards gives further guidance on the concepts of credibility and reliability.

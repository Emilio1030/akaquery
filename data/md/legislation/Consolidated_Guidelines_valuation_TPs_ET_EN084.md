Technical Annex I - Simplification for the attribution of the overhead expenses  
 
The recurrent overhead expenses are defined in the following manner:  
 
𝑆𝑆𝑅𝑅𝐴𝐴𝑡𝑡=𝑆𝑆𝑅𝑅𝑙𝑙𝑙𝑙𝑙𝑙𝑡𝑡∙�𝑆𝑆𝑅𝑅𝑛𝑛𝑛𝑛𝑛𝑛𝑡𝑡
𝑆𝑆𝑅𝑅𝑙𝑙𝑙𝑙𝑙𝑙𝑡𝑡�1
2
∙𝑠𝑠+13−𝑡𝑡
12(𝑠𝑠+12) 
Where:  
 
s = expected duration in months to fully settle any obligation arising from the insurance contract, 
since the start of insurance cover  
𝑡𝑡= 1, … , 12 month of the projection period  
𝑆𝑆𝑅𝑅𝑙𝑙𝑙𝑙𝑙𝑙𝑡𝑡 = recurrent overhead expenses observed during last 12 months  
𝑆𝑆𝑅𝑅𝑛𝑛𝑛𝑛𝑛𝑛𝑡𝑡 = recurrent overhead expenses anticipated for next 12 months  
𝑆𝑆
𝑅𝑅𝐴𝐴𝑡𝑡 = recurrent overhead expenses attributable to month t

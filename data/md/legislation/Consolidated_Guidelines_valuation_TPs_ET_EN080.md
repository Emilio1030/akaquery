c) Analysis of settled vs. reported or paid over incurred claims ratios;  
d) Graphs to validate the use of a pattern. For example, the accident year patterns may be 
plotted against the final selected patterns;  
e) Identifying the existence of any biases or other distorting effects within data which are no t 
representative of current expectations. For example, a company may have recently 
merged with another. As a result, a specific line of business may produce a distribution of 
reserves which is significantly skewed in comparison to the distribution prior to  the 
merger. This may suggest the need to separate both portfolios, even if they are within the 
same line of business.  
2. Examples of approaches and processes that may help to understand the sensitivity of the technical provisions to the underlying assumptions:  
- Stress and scenario testing in order to:  
a) Understand any non -linearity between different assumptions;  
b) Ensure that the estimation is robust and weaknesses/uncertainty have been addressed;  
c) Get further insight into the tail of the loss distributio n.  
- Sensitivity analysis can be used in order to assess the extent to which results are sensitive to the underlying assumptions and models. This can be performed by 
introducing small and large changes to parameters or additional data points.  
- The sensitivi ty to changes in assumptions has to be explored one change at a time 
in order to identify their importance.  
3. Examples of approaches that may help to test the quality of fit and/or appropriateness of the model for valuing technical provisions:  
a) Produce several sets of estimators (curves of distribution of the estimators) and assess how well they describe the data. There are several ways undertakings can do this before they calculate the best estimate of the provisions. For example, they can plot age to age 
factors against the estimators. From this they will be able to assess which curve fits best;  
b) Test different curves and extrapolate a tail factor if necessary;  
c) Statistical diagnostics techniques such as goodness of fit tests, including analysis  of 
residuals, sum of squares, Akaike information criterion and non parametric smoothing, etc.;  
d) Where individual contracts have been grouped into model points, tests for the goodness 
of fit of the grouped model points compared with the individual policy d ata records 
should be carried out. This should also include considering the impact of grouping under 
different scenarios.

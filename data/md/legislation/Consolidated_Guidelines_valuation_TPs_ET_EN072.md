b) regardless  of  the  lega l  or  contractual  terms  applicable  to  the  contract,  the calculation  
should  not  include  penalties,  reductions  or  any  other  type  of adjustment  to  the  
theoretical  actuarial  valuation  of  technical  provisions without  a  risk  margin  c alculated  
as  though  the  policy  continued  to  be  in force.  
All the other assumptions (e.g. mortality, lapses or expenses) should remain unchanged. This 
means that the insurance and reinsurance undertakings should apply the same projection 
horizon, fu ture management actions and policyholder option exercise rates used in best 
estimate calculation without adjusting them to consider that future premiums will not be 
received. Even if all assumptions on expenses should remain constant, the level of some 
expenses (e.g. acquisition expenses or investment management expenses) could be indirectly 
affected.  
Explanatory text  
180. As stated in Article 260(2) of the Delegated Regulation, EPIFP is determined as the 
difference between the official calculation of technical provisions without risk margin and a calculation of technical provisions without risk margin under the assumption t hat future 
premiums (and related benefits) expected to emerge from existing contracts will not occur.  
181. The methodology described is based on a difference between two different calculations of 
technical provisions without risk margin, so it is crucial that both terms of the subtraction 
are calculated following the same approach and technical hypothesis, with the only exception that in the additional technical provisions without risk margin calculation no 
future premiums will be included.  
182. As written above, t he technical hypothesis should remain unchanged to guarantee 
coherence among the official technical provisions without risk margin and technical 
provisions without risk margin under the assumption that future premiums (and related benefits) expected to emerge from existing contracts will not occur.  
183. This means that the projection of future cash flows should not change when valuating EPIFP , 
i.e. the calculation should be only a matter of identifying the cash flows related to future 
premiums and taking them o ut from the calculation without altering the remaining cash 
flows.  
184. In order to avoid divergent practices on expenses projection applied on technical provisions without risk margin without future premiums, it is important to underline the following 
consider ations:
